# Whatever it takes



***An alternative account of the events of Friday, March 22, 2019.***

Williams did not understand.

There was no agenda or explanation offered, only a time and a place. Three o’clock at the Board’s offices—could he make it?  Williams had hesitated for a moment before agreeing. Although he had many questions and reservations at the time, he decided that it would be unwise to press any further. The chairman, whose voice was inflected with audible urgency, seemed unlikely to offer any answers. 

Still, Williams was annoyed at his boss’ sudden request. It was plainly unreasonable to expect the regional president of the New York branch—the most prestigious of all the branches—to simply drop all of his work to hop onto the next train to DC. Moreover, the complete mystery of the request tortured Williams with his own sense of curiosity.

He glanced down now at the small table in front of him. Both his MacBook and a half-eaten Café Acela sandwich competed for his attention. He sighed as he shut the laptop’s lid to continue his lunch, in quiet communion with the other solitary riders. It was not like he could prepare materials for a meeting he knew nothing about anyway. 

It was already an inauspicious day with the ten year dipping below the three month tenor. The mysterious phone call lent the yield curve inversion an almost sinister edge. Were the two things somehow connected? He rejected the idea. Surely the Board of Governors had more important matters to worry about. Matters that, for some reason, could not be resolved remotely through a conference call.

He had just left DC a mere two days ago, having attended lengthy discussions between the chairman, the governors, and the other regional presidents from Tuesday to Wednesday. Together the committee had arrived at the anti-climactic decision to leave things as they were, along with a promise to revisit the matter in three months time. The benchmark rate, like most things, was better off left untouched.  His eyelids grew heavy as he reviewed the results of years of committee meetings in his head. It was difficult to resist the soft lull of the drifting train.

Williams woke up just in time to see the train pull into Washington Union station. Dusting off the crumbs on his shirt, he made his way to the portico outside the entrance of the Main Hall for a taxi. In no time, he was cruising down the length of Constitution Avenue, riding past the monuments and memorials of the National Mall. Everything was running according to schedule.

The taxi dropped him off at the entrance of the Marriner S. Eccles building, which cut a striking figure against the clear spring sky. The building was a rectilinear behemoth of Georgia marble. While neither elegant nor quite ugly, its exterior exuded a neoclassical boredom as unimaginative as the four floors of functionaries who filled it. Perhaps it was only natural that, in a city so teeming with ornate landmarks to power, the true seat of power would be found in an otherwise unremarkable structure.

“I’m back,” he whispered to himself.

The chairman was already waiting when he stepped into the conference room. The ambience reminded him of a very austere kindergarten, where each committee member customarily sat behind his or her emblazoned nameplate on the vast wooden table. At the center, of course, was Chairman Powell, flanked by Governors Clarida, Quarles, Bowman, and Brainard, or as he knew them—Jay, Richard, Randy, Miki, and Lael. The governors were absent today, as were any of the usual observers and hangers-on inserted in the name of “transparency,” though their names still shone on the table.

“Hi John,” Powell greeted him half-heartedly. “Thanks for coming all the way here from New York.”

“No problem at all,” Williams lied as he closed the door behind him, sealing off the room. “Nice to see you again.”

Williams mustered a smile to a limited degree of success. Powell remained grim.

Williams took the seat across from the chairman, positioning himself next to an unguarded bottle Poland Spring. 

“I’m sure you have many questions for me,” Powell began. Any note of worry had been wrung from his voice. He now spoke with the same gravitas he used for communicating the committee’s esoteric decisions to the outside world. 

“Yes,” Williams said as he nodded. “I would like to know why am I here.”

“To understand that,” Powell said. “You must first understand why *we* are here."

The greying chairman pulled out a sheaf of papers and slid them across the table. It was an typewritten monograph with the nondescript title: *A Review of Anticipatory Systems*. There was no author indicated. Williams thumbed through the text and the feel of the pages returned him for a moment back to graduate school, sweating in front of his dissertation committee. Although some of the notations were unfamiliar and the writing slightly archaic, it was written in a mathematical language he was fluent in.

Powell watched silently as Williams flipped through page after page, his fingers woven into the stack as impromptu bookmarks. He could not follow every single thread, but such was the price of experiencing the monograph’s brilliance for the first time. The chairman was awfully quiet, Williams thought as the hours ticked by.

Williams looked up and saw that Powell’s eyes twinkled back at him. “Do you have a question for me now?”

“This is interesting,” Williams said. “But I’m not sure why this is relevant.”

“Aren’t financial systems anticipatory systems?” Powell said.

“Well, yes. The introduction says as much.” He repeated the line in the opening paragraph. “The simplest anticipatory system has three parts: itself, a predictive model of its own future, and a mechanism to act upon itself based on that model. Examples can be found in biology, finance, psychology, and any other field concerning behavior.”

Powell nodded. “And when you were reading it, didn’t something feel odd to you?”

It was certainly odd to be reading some paper from an unknown era while being intently observed by a stone-quiet man in a suit. But that was not what Powell was getting at.

“Yes,” Williams said. “It feels intentionally incomplete.”

“The *Review* was never finished,” Powell said. “Its author committed suicide right after arranging for a copy of her original German manuscript to be smuggled across the Atlantic into the hands of the New York Fed. Little more is known.”

It was not rare for genius to be entwined with madness, Williams thought, and the *Review* certainly suggested both.

The writing circled around three core insights.

Suppose there was a network of individual anticipatory systems that interacted with each other. The predictive model of each individual would depend not only on the behavior, but also on the predictive models of their neighbors, much like a vast multidimensional game of poker.

In a stroke of mathematical elegance, that author claimed it was equally valid to take the opposite view of the situation, not as a network of individuals but as a network of *models*. Predictive models were like ghosts who possessed the individual systems whose behavior they controlled. No longer did systems form models. Once these models were formed, the models shaped the systems themselves. A poker game not between humans, but between different poker playing strategies. Such was the first instinct.

Although the models were in every sense as “real” as the actual systems themselves, there was an important difference. Systems behaved in a strictly causal way, with one interaction leading to and causing another, whereas it was impossible to speak of models in terms of causality in any meaningful way.  

The “meta-behavior” of prediction models playing off against each other was timeless. In a game of rock, paper, scissors, the metaphysical rock beats scissors, now, then, and forever. As such, the meta-behavior of prediction models was also far more predictable that the behavior of actual systems.

Even if the myriad interactions between individuals in a crowd could be exhaustively catalogued, there was no easy to predict the collective behavior of these individuals once the number of individuals became overwhelming. On the other hand, it was possible to set up games, where interacting systems of rules and strategies would converge on completely predictable outcomes no what what happened. For a example, a tournament may be set up such that only one individual wins, even if such a winning condition were not explicitly dictated. Such was the second insight.

As elegant as it was, the dual view of networks of individuals as networks of models was more of a mathematical curiosity than a true description of the physical world, where causality reigned supreme. However, as the numbers of individuals in the networks increased and their interconnections and mutual expectations were wound ever more tightly, the better this approximation would be. The more the models could come to life. Such was the final insight.

In such a world, if it could be achieved, the difference between prediction and action—between prophesy and future— was a meaningless one.

“Why did she send it to us?” Williams asked. “And why did we keep it?”

“The author of the *Review* had a dream,” Powell said. “And we had the means to achieve it. We control the most liquid predictive market in the world, connecting traders and investors across the world.”

“You don’t mean…”

“The new Fed was born in the flames of the Second World War,” Powell spoke slowly. “The moment Marriner Eccles received the translation of her manuscript in 1941.”

“What is the Fed actually doing?!” Williams said, standing from his seat.

“You cannot even imagine,” Powell shook as he placed his eyeglasses on the table. “What it means to control the yield curve.”

Yield curve control? Wasn’t that the newfangled policy that the Bank of Japan had first rolled out. Williams looked at Powell blankly.

“Wait,” Williams muttered to himself. “The yield curve does not predict central bank intervention. The change in the yield curve *IS* central bank intervention.”

Powell laughed heartily as he saw the flash of realization over Williams’ face. He had been waiting ever so patiently for this moment.

“The yield curve whispers to us from the future,” Powell said. “Because we have set up a massive anticipatory network to encode messages to send back to our past selves.”

This was all so ridiculous to Williams, but not much more so than the retconned creation mythology of the Federal Reserve. He had nursed his own private doubts about the dual mandate of late, views which he dared not air in public.

“The Federal Reserve acts as the eyes of the Republic, providing advance warning of threats to our democracy,” Powell said proudly. “Our stewardship of capital markets is of secondary concern.”

Williams plopped back into his chair, ready to receive his true mission.

“The treasury market transmission network is a perfect one. Given our limitations, we can send only the simplest messages, if we don’t want them to become garbled after being deconvoluted far enough back in time. The clearest signal we discovered was to invert the yield curve. We encode information in the tenors and timing of the inversion.

“Last December, the three year and five year inverted, followed by the two year and five year one day after. According to our messaging protocol, this pattern of inversions signaled mass unrest within two years, with more information to follow. We proceeded by calibrating our antennae, if you will, by adjusting the federal feds rate upward until we received a follow-up signal. Today the second part of message hit when the three month and ten year inverted. America will be hit with a global pandemic.

“We’ve tried to warn the executive branch about it. However, unlike in the past, the executive branch is not responding as decisively to the intelligence as we had hoped. The situation is grim. There is only so much the eyes of the Republic can do. This is the first time we have operated alone.”

“Does no one else know who can help?” Williams asked.

“The true purpose of the Federal Reserve is only revealed to the President, a few of his or her trusted advisors, and me,” Powell said.” Powell said. “I’m breaching protocol by telling you. But I believe there’s a special destiny that comes with working at the New York Fed.”

“Thanks but I’m not sure how I can help.”

“To be frank with you, I’m not exactly sure what to do either. But I’ve always known you to have a good head on your shoulders. We’ll think of something.”

“Okay.”

“And we’re going to have to meet in person more often than our quarterly FOMC committee meetings.”

“Sure,” Williams agreed with a sense of dread. Even with the weight of the country on his shoulders, he did not like long commutes to the capital.

“It’s only six,” Powell said, glancing at the clock. “Are you up to join me for an early supper? My treat, of course.”

“Let me tell my family then,” Williams said. “And *I* will pick the restaurant this time.”

Powell laughed again as he reached for his bag and adjusted his tie.

“So it’s all a waste of time then?”

“What?”

“All the discussion about the economy and rate hikes and rate cuts? It’s all just a front for fiddling with the dials on a massive time machine.”

“Correct.”

“No wonder it never made any sense.”

“And the plunge protection team actually exists.”

“Yea I know, the Working Group on Financial Markets…”

“Not that one. There’s a group of Fed traders who manipulate futures around two and three AM in the morning. It’s a short wave communication system that allows us to send messages months rather than years into the past.”

“Man, what else are you hiding?”

Powell winked. “The Eccles building is large for a reason.”



The End.

“I don’t quite see the difference.”

“Theoretically, there is a distinction,” Bowman said. “Practically, no.”





“Are you familiar with the theory of anticipatory systems?” Powell asked.

“I’m afraid not,” Williams said. He remembered hearing the term in graduate school and about how it was somehow related to acausal systems theory, but he struggled to recall much beyond that.

“We’ll keep the mathematics to a minimum so I can convey the basic idea to you.” Powell cleared his throat. “You can refe”

It is not difficult 

but that’s where they existed. On paper.

Financial systems are a classic example anticipatory systems, where the current output of the system depends to some degree on future inputs to the system. This allows them to exhibit strange behavior that cannot occur in physical systems. We had known this quite early on, this was a curious theoretical results with seemingly no known application. That is, until the Federal Reserve was created.

Czaternov and Rogolski showed that in a sufficiently vast and liquid market, with a sufficiently distributed number of participants. And sufficiently large reserves of capital or power to move such a market.

It would be possible to send signals in time.

The most signal we discovered, was to invert the yield curve.

It was a style unappreciated by the observers who lurked in their meetings for the stated interest of transparency and the implacable pundits who spun his words into whatever they wished.

Unlike the others, Williams found Powell’s stage voice to be oddly soothing

This style of speaking had not come naturally to him. It was honed slowly over time through imitation of previous central bankers. Still, Powell often defaulted to his native dialect of plain English when he thought it was necessary, reverting back to banker-speak as appropriate. Even if Powell was often criticized for it, Williams admired the chairman’s ability to code-switch. It lent him a solidity that his academic predecessors failed to possess.

“Why am I here?” Williams blurted, unable to restrain his curiosity any longer.

“The regional president of the New York branch of the Federal Reserve is a esteemed position,” Powell continued. “In times of trouble, it has a special role to play.”

“Even so, there are some secrets that you do not know. Until of course, you are needed.”

“monetary stability. there are more important things in this world.”

He knew the dual mandate by heart.

“Well there are more important things”

well of course there were more important things in heaven and earth, than are managed by monetary policy. There was no business by central bankers.

John,” Powell began. “Listen closely because you’re going to have to remember all of this in your head.”

“I’m listening.”

“And it’s going to sound completely crazy,” Powell continued, as the governors nodded in assent. “But it’s the god-honest truth.”

“Okay.”

“The yield curve. It whispers to us.”

 This took Williams by surprise. Powell, who usually spoke in plain English, was not given to poetry or academic obfuscation.

l held a news conference after a board meeting. He provided an update on the U.S. economy and indicated that the central bank would leave  interest rates unchanged. In addition, he announced that the [Federal Reserve](https://www.c-span.org/organization/?39431/Federal-Reserve) would end its balance sheet reduction program in September 2019.  Following his opening statement, he took questions from reporters in  attendance.

The Federal Reserve decided Wednesday to hold interest rates steady and indicated that no more hikes will be coming this year.

In a unanimous move that coincides with market expectations and demands,  the central bank’s policymaking Federal Open Market Committee took a  sharp dovish turn from policy projections just three months earlier.



After the announcement, [10-year Treasury yields fell](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/20/us-treasury-yields-tick-lower-ahead-of-fed-rate-decision.html) to their lowest level in a year.

Williams worried. The chairman’s words had been inflected with audible anxiety, devoid of the usual gravitas he wielded when delivering the committee’s esoteric decisions to the press.
