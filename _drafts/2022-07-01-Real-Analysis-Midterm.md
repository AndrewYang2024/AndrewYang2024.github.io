{%newthought ' The Russian invasion '%} of Ukraine reignited mainstream interest among Western audiences in the post-Soviet world. Overnight, Russia experts who had been languishing in relative obscurity were suddenly invited onto prestige and new media to feed the demand for war-related content. This boom was especially pronounced in the rise of military analysts specializing in the post-Soviet space into minor celebrities on social media. Now as the war draws to its end, these experts are once again retreading the path of the generation before them, the Kremlinologists who were forced to seek new forms of employment after the shock dissolution of the Soviet Union.

One such successful reinventing has been that of Michael Kofman, the former director of Russia studies at the now-defunct nonprofit research organization the Center for Naval Analyses. Previously known for his circumspect analysis as an expert on the Russian military, he is now a commentator on domestic political conflict within the United States. The following interview, which has been lightly edited for clarity, details the story of his recent trajectory, his unique insights into the workings of American politics, and the trajectory of the country he now covers.

**Six months ago, you laid out the strategic errors of the Russian invasion in a wide-ranging [*conversation in this magazine*](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-russian-militarys-debacle-in-ukraine). Now that Russia has bowed out of the conflict after paying dearly for those mistakes, we find ourselves again at opposite ends of the telephone to share in your expertise. Before we delve into the upcoming midterm elections, I’d like to know how you pivoted from military analyst to pundit.**

Thank you for having me on again. It’s my pleasure.

Quite frankly, I did not anticipate the surrender of the Russian military after the Kherson counteroffensive. I understood the offensive to be a limited operation designed by the Ukrainian general staff to avoid any major battles with massive casualties. The objective was simply to isolate the Russian forces stationed at and around Kherson in order to make those positions untenable over time such that they would have to be pulled back across the Dnieper River. The retaking of the city of Kherson would be an important step forward but the war would remain protracted.

What I did not see coming was that the loss of Kherson would give Putin a heart attack and force him to hand power down to Patrushev **[Nikolai Patrushev, Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation]** who decided to retreat all Russian regular and other mobilized forces from Ukraine entirely, including Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk oblasts. If was as if the late Gorbachev had come back from the dead to possess Patrushev, who turned out to be surprisingly in favor of engagement with the West. He encouraged Ukraine to join NATO while making explicit overtures about integrating the Russian Federation with NATO to counterbalance the rise of China. 

Once that happened, I realized that this was going to be the last nail in the coffin for my profession. I knew that all funding for all Russia policy and related think tanks were going to be mercilessly cut because Russia was now part of the rules-based international order. And so I decided to look for something else to do.

**But why domestic American politics? Did you previously have an interest or expertise in this area?**

I want to be absolutely clear—I don’t have any credentials in this domain. But one thing I have learned while covering the Ukrainian conflict is that you don’t necessarily need credentials to cover important subjects in the era of social media. I don’t mean to be dismissive, but I’ve seen some takes that tried to predict the trajectory of an entire conflict based on observations of tire pressure. So I figured that I could do a little better than that given my background as an analyst.

That being said, I have always paid attention to domestic politics. The Center for Naval Analyses was headquartered in Arlington and I was often in DC for briefings and other events with colleagues. Given that proximity, it would be rather difficult not to pay attention. I would notice, in particular, that the predictions made by my politically minded colleagues at cocktail parties turned out more often than not to be incorrect. 

**Was there a time you felt like you could do better? **

Back in 2021, I was invited to a New Year’s party in DC where everyone was chattering about the recently held election with a complete sense of complacency. It seems you can convince some folks of anything except for the outbreak of political violence. The events of January 6th should not have come as a surprise to the political establishment.

millions of voters across the U.S. turned out to the polls for the midterm elections. Despite worries about surging Republican turnout, the Democratic Party has held up better than experts predicted, and Republican advances have been slower than feared. The midterm shellacking expected for the incumbent party has failed to materialize and both sides are now confronting the prospect of an increasingly ugly and lengthy campaign into 2024. What strategic errors has the Republican party made, and why?

To help answer these questions, I recently spoke by phone with Michael Kofman, the director of Russia studies at the nonprofit research organization the Center for Naval Analyses and an expert on the Russian military. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we also discussed how the Republican party and its voters have changed since the end of the Cold War, whether its missteps have hampered its political aims, and the dangers of electoral conflict spiralling out of control.

**Let’s start at the beginning of it all. Most observers during the 2020 election expected it to be heated but ultimately result in a peaceful transition of power. You were one of the few voices predicting the outbreak of political violence months before the initial attack on January 6th. How did you arrive at that analysis?**

First off, you should be deeply skeptical any time someone declares the exercise of political violence to be obsolete. History is filled with examples otherwise. Second, simple monitoring of open-source intelligence (OSINT) picked up signs of mobilization as as early as September, when the hashtag #StopTheSteal began to trend. Early on, there was a question as to whether the campaign to contest the upcoming election results was a negotiating tactic to secure concessions against long-standing grievances of 

 to strengthen the Republicans’ hand in . We suspected that the Republicans would focus their efforts on contesting the electoral results in Republican-leaning eras.

**Let’s talk about one of the underreported yet crucial aspects of this war, the Republican blockade, which has completely stopped the flow of legislation out of Congress. Are there any workable solutions to lift the blockade?**

The U.S. economy has been decelerating since the beginning of the war. contracting will continue to suffer as long as the blockade continues. It is unlikely that negotiations to lift the blockade will succeed as long as the Republicans see it as leverage in further negotiations down the line.

**The expert consensus on the state of the race was quite dire in the months leading up the midterm elections, with projections of deeply red political maps. What happened?**

I think that we in the analytical community both overestimated the Republican capabilities and underestimated the Democratic side. The months leading up to the elections were frankly quite puzzling. For example, the Republicans have formidable electronic warfare capabilities, which we have seen before, most notably well-funded outfits such as Cambridge Analytica in the 2016 election. This was almost entirely absent this time around.

And despite deep investments in media, the Republicans were also unable to achieve air-time superiority .
