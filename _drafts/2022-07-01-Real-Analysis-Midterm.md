**By Isaac Chotiner**

{%newthought ' Two weeks ago, '%}  millions of voters across the U.S. turned out to the polls for the midterm elections. Despite worries about surging Republican turnout, the Democratic Party has held up better than experts predicted, and Republican advances have been slower than feared. The midterm shellacking expected for the incumbent party has failed to materialize and both sides are now confronting the prospect of an increasingly ugly and lengthy campaign into 2024. What strategic errors has the Republican party made, and why?

To help answer these questions, I recently spoke by phone with Michael Kofman, the director of Russia studies at the nonprofit research organization the Center for Naval Analyses and an expert on the Russian military. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we also discussed how the Republican party and its voters have changed since the end of the Cold War, whether its missteps have hampered its political aims, and the dangers of electoral conflict spiralling out of control.



**Given the poor performance of Trump-endorsed candidates such as Mary Miller (ILL-15) and Mehmet Oz (PA-SEN), is Trumpism now obsolete as a political force?**

If you can show me a platform that can deploy the same rhetorical firepower and depth of mass appeal, I’d like to see it. The “death of Trumpism” has been declared repeatedly in the past. As long as military doctrine demands it, militaries will not retire a capability

combined arms operations. In many cases, Trump swooped in, late in the race to drop his endorsement. unsupported

The Republicans are failing to follow their own doctrine.

**The expert consensus on the state of the race was quite dire in the months leading up the midterm elections, with projections of deeply red political maps. What happened?**

I think that we in the analytical community both overestimated the Republican capabilities and underestimated the Democratic side. The months leading up to the elections were frankly quite puzzling. For example, the Republicans have formidable electronic warfare capabilities, which we have seen before, most notably well-funded outfits such as Cambridge Analytica in the 2016 election. This was almost entirely absent this time around.

And despite deep investments in media, the Republicans were also unable to achieve air-time superiority .
