{%newthought ' Two weeks ago, '%}  voters across the U.S. went to the polls to turn out for the midterm election. Despite the worry caused by the surging Republican voter turnout, the Democratic Party has held up better than experts predicted, and Republican advances have been slower than feared. Now the former President Donald Trump—who already faces sweeping financial sanctions—is confronting the prospect of an increasingly ugly and lengthy campaign to contest the votes of Democratic enclaves to ensure his successful presidential bid in the next election. What strategic errors has the Republican party made, if any, and why?

To help answer these questions, I recently spoke by phone with Michael Kofman, the director of Russia studies at the nonprofit research organization the Center for Naval Analyses and an expert on the Russian military. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we also discussed how the Republican party and its voters have changed since the end of the Cold War, whether its missteps have hampered its political aims, and the dangers of electoral conflict spiralling out of control.

**The expert consensus on the state of the race was quite dire in the weeks leading up the election, with projections of deeply red political maps. What happened?**

I think that we in the analytical community overestimated the Republican capabilities and underestimated the Democratic side. electronic warfare. Where was the hybrid warfare?

**Given that political tensions are high in the U.S. and the country is on the verge of civil war. I understand that this topic is outside your area of expertise.**

Frankly,  I.



**If the Democrats wish to win the next presidential election, should they retire Biden? His approval rating is rock-bottom and Democratic candidates who kept their distance from or explicitly denounced Biden seemed to outperform their peers**
