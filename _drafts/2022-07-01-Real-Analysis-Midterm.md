Below is a series of converstsations. 



millions of voters across the U.S. turned out to the polls for the midterm elections. Despite worries about surging Republican turnout, the Democratic Party has held up better than experts predicted, and Republican advances have been slower than feared. The midterm shellacking expected for the incumbent party has failed to materialize and both sides are now confronting the prospect of an increasingly ugly and lengthy campaign into 2024. What strategic errors has the Republican party made, and why?

To help answer these questions, I recently spoke by phone with Michael Kofman, the director of Russia studies at the nonprofit research organization the Center for Naval Analyses and an expert on the Russian military. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we also discussed how the Republican party and its voters have changed since the end of the Cold War, whether its missteps have hampered its political aims, and the dangers of electoral conflict spiralling out of control.

**Let’s start at the beginning of it all. Most observers during the 2020 election expected it to be heated but ultimately result in a peaceful transition of power. You were one of the few voices predicting the outbreak of political violence months before the initial attack on January 6th. How did you arrive at that analysis?**

First off, you should be deeply skeptical any time someone declares the exercise of political violence to be obsolete. History is filled with examples otherwise. Second, simple monitoring of open-source intelligence (OSINT) picked up signs of mobilization as as early as September, when the hashtag #StopTheSteal began to trend. Early on, there was a question as to whether the campaign to contest the upcoming election results was a negotiating tactic to secure concessions against long-standing grievances of 

 to strengthen the Republicans’ hand in . We suspected that the Republicans would focus their efforts on contesting the electoral results in Republican-leaning eras.

**Let’s talk about one of the underreported yet crucial aspects of this war, the Republican blockade, which has completely stopped the flow of legislation out of Congress. Are there any workable solutions to lift the blockade?**

The U.S. economy has been decelerating since the beginning of the war. contracting will continue to suffer as long as the blockade continues. It is unlikely that negotiations to lift the blockade will succeed as long as the Republicans see it as leverage in further negotiations down the line.

**The expert consensus on the state of the race was quite dire in the months leading up the midterm elections, with projections of deeply red political maps. What happened?**

I think that we in the analytical community both overestimated the Republican capabilities and underestimated the Democratic side. The months leading up to the elections were frankly quite puzzling. For example, the Republicans have formidable electronic warfare capabilities, which we have seen before, most notably well-funded outfits such as Cambridge Analytica in the 2016 election. This was almost entirely absent this time around.

And despite deep investments in media, the Republicans were also unable to achieve air-time superiority .
