The main problem that dating apps struggle with is cultivating their user-base and keeping them engaged. The network effects are brutal. It doesn’t matter how good the matching algorithms or user interfaces are, if the users on the platform simply aren’t appealing to each other. And even if you have enough likeable people, finding a good match always takes time. It might take months for compatible individuals to exit their existing relationships before seeking new ones. We can reduce search time with better algorithms, but we can’t eliminate the wait time that is embedded in the rhythm of human interaction.

However, we can still keep users engaged before their ideal picks appear on the market. For example, A is compatible with B, but B is dating someone else. You can hire a professional actor who matches with A to keep A occupied. The actor will then break up with A when B is single again. As long as the professional actor is the best hookup candidate among the A’s available matches, (best bid), A is better off than being single or matching with anyone else.

I think this is a game-changer for online dating brokerages. The leading company in this space is Cathedral, named after their desire to facilitate more seamless unions. Cathedral’s high-frequency matchmakers have a reputation for literally f**king both sides, but I believe that they are providing useful liquidity to dating markets.

Recently, there was a controversy when a bunch of attractive people intentionally matched with unattractive ones, creating a shortage of pretty faces on dating services. The dealers were forced to find more attractive people and pay them to sign up for their app. This was known as a “gamma squeeze,” because of they obtained these people from fraternities and sororities (the Greeks). When this situation worsened, they simply prevented not-hotties from dating hotties.

The fallout of these dating restrictions is still being litigated today. While it seems like dating apps will take a hit, Cathedral was able to profit handsomely in the kerfluffle.
