I’m not sure if I have ever encountered an unironic use of *woke* in the wild. The first time I ever heard the word was on the Daily Show, where *woke* was benignly funny in the same way a middle-aged late-night host saying *on fleek* or some other newfangled internet lingo on air was. Now I only encounter *woke* in the pejorative sense, as the root cause of problems of late modernity.

This is a pity, because *woke* is actually a useful word to describe the cultural phenomenon that emerged out of the 2010s in progressive circles, the same time *woke* hopped from African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) into the mainstream by way of Black Twitter, which gave us *on fleek*, *based*, *you finna die*, and other gems of language.

Even if the word has been stretched into meaningless, any progressive or conservative would agree that the following sentence is obviously *woke*, whether or not they agreed with its meaning.

“We must center the experiences of black women as we save this country from the forces of white supremacy.”

There is something in its jargon, style, and affect that is instantly recognizable to the modern observer.

However, the sentiment expressed above would not have been entirely unintelligible to an earlier era. It was no secret that the spotlight of the civil rights movement of the 1960s was dominated by charismatic men. To be a Black woman in the segregationist South was to be doubly condemned, on the basis of race and then of gender. In that light, I can perfectly imagine an old preacher from Atlanta calling on his congregation to remind themselves of the experiences of Black women in the struggle against segregation. And it would have been good advice! The movement needed the energy of women organizers—many of whom were written out of and belatedly added back into civil rights history—and it hurt the movement to alienate them. 

However, there *is* something to 2010s progressive activism that can not be translated to the 1960s. It is by pinning down that missing element of cultural understanding, that we can begin to arrive at a definition of *wokeness*.

## Definition

I will try my best here at a neutral definition of *wokeness*, as a thing I am trying to describe and explain, rather than as a bogeyman to fear or as part of a political program to promote.

Although wokeness is associated with a set of specific political positions, it is not *inherent* to them.

Let us consider the activist language of *same-sex marriage* versus *queer rights*. The phrasing of same-sex marriage asks that society simply tweak its existing notion of marriage to include one where the sex of one partner has been interchanged. Whereas, the language of queer rights explicitly asks society to confront the existence distinct queer identities. It recognizes that LGBT relationships aren’t merely an extension of a franchise developed by heterosexuals, but something distinct unto themselves.

From a branding perspective, calling it same-sex marriage may have been the better pitch when convincing skeptics about legalization. However, the second approach strikes me as a more honest one. The dynamics of queer relationships do generally differ from those of straight relationships. And queer couples do generally view their queerness differently than straight couples think (or not think) about their own straightness. Although I do not think these differences matter from the legal standpoint of granting marriage licenses, I do think they are meaningful to talk about.

Neither *same-sex marriage* nor *LGBT rights* conveys a different view on equal rights, but they do suggest different ways to get there. The former especially appeals to a polite, middle-class sensibility of solidarity while the latter is explicitly affirmational. By asserting one’s pride of place, one directly confronts an unjust society and one’s own internalized grief from their minority status.  *I’m here and I’m queer*. 

Progressivism, speaking broadly, seeks to reduce the imbalances between disadvantaged groups and advantaged ones by securing equal resources and/or legal rights. Wokeness is the view that this process is intrinsically tied to securing representation in the cultural realm even if it means—especially it means—an uncomfortable confrontation with the majority. There is no option to just be folded into the majority culture while enjoying equal rights, because meaningful equality cannot truly happen without full recognition.

History is littered with examples of ethnic and religious minorities who were subject to pogroms and expulsions, despite coexisting with their neighbors quite well for centuries. Blending into the background seems like a pretty good deal until it’s not. As such, it’s not a bad idea to attain some degree of cultural visibility, as a form of protection against that. One can join the imperial court of the reigning monarch and writing your people as helpers and heroes in popular literature rather than their usual depictions as child-snatchers or whatever ghoulish caricature. Along the way, you also develop pride about your own identity, allowing you to participate fully in life without keeping your head down.

Where wokeness diverges from history is that its form of identity politics isn’t attached to a specific marginalized identity. Its state of flux is reflected in its evolving acronyms, which both refine (POC to BIPOC) and expand (LGBT to LGBTQIA+) categories as they acquire more letters. It is by listing out the numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, … that we arrive at the notion of the *set of natural numbers* denoted by the symbol of the double-struck capital N, which isn’t a number at all. Similarly, the identity in identity politics has no identity, except as an eternal variable or placeholder for something else to come.

The lack of specificity is the logical conclusion if one considers all marginalized identities to be valid. In practice, there may be implicit or explicit hierarchies depending on what people are present in a given context and the views they hold, but in theory, the movement does not want to commit itself to any explicit enumeration of sanctioned identities. Instead, it encourages the exploration of new identities among its members as part of liberation from forms of marginalization we may not even perceive except after we explore our personal experiences. Diversity, in wokeness, is not simply a signal that the progressive project of securing benefits and rights is working, an indicator that the distribution of advantages are probabilistically even. Diversity is an end in itself, part and parcel of liberation.

This presents a challenge. Organizing a diverse group of people is very hard. Organize people based on a non-specific idea of identity, is astronomically hard. That is, unless you evolve some interchangeable set of practices and language that can be shared even among hyper-specific categories of identity.

We all may not have the same identity, but we all at least *have* one. 

Hence, there is a strong focus in wokeness about personal experience. By commiserating about how our identity has brought us personal adversity in one way or another, and celebrating the moments where we felt a personal triumph in affirming that identity, it provides the vital link that holds the whole enterprise together. The resulting structure, by intentionally embracing some degree of fragmentation within, is resilient—even antifragile. Again, because diversity is an end of itself, it becomes a connective tissue rather than a liability.

Take for example, the example of the straight white male. If he chooses to participate, he is now a white cishet. While white cishet may be statistically, the majority, it is now just another category under the spectrum. He can participate in the same commiseration and celebration with his newfound allies, albeit in a different form. His confrontation with marginalization is at the opposite end, as the one unconsciously imposing marginalization on others. An outside critic might think it a raw deal, but he might feel just fine. He may feel more in tune with who he is, not just as a random guy who popped into being one day but as an individual in the larger sweep of social history. He is, in its own way, welcomed to the (ever-expanding) club.

Because personal experience is the connective tissue that holds it all together, there isn’t a boundary between one’s personal and political life. The drama of the political struggle plays out in the theater of everyday living, and vice versa. The constant awareness of this extra dimension to everyday life, this back-and-forth between the general and the particular until you can no longer distinguish between the two, is precisely embodied by the word *woke,* to be aware—right now, back then, and always.

The use of *whiteness* and *anti-blackness* refer as much to faceless, structural forms of discriminations as to specific instances of white individuals one encountered recently. In fact, even in the same breath.

To complete the unity of everything, there also isn’t a boundary between one political issue and another another. As all politics is about people, and all people suffer because of their marginalization, there is a dimension of identity to all the major issues of our time, whether it be racial justice (obviously) or climate change (now addressed as climate justice because it is also about protecting Black and Brown communities impacted by rising sea levels and the like). 

To return to the beginning, *wokeness* is not a policy platform. It is an paradigm that is layered onto different progressive policies to glue them into one movement by using a generalized construct of identity and encouraging a constant level of awareness of it.

Considering its rise over the last decade, I would say that wokeness is actually pretty successful at mobilizing people, if that is the criterion by which one considers success. I think all politics is unnatural, which is why people, as a general rule, are reluctant to “get political.” By incorporating the personal dimension, it makes politics highly accessible and even fun. (The role of fun in politics is often underrated and de-emphasized to preserve the sanctity and seriousness of the venture. But the essence of having a good time every now and then would have been as relevant to a peasant revolt then as it is now) 

But I would be careful not to conflate the rise of wokeness with the general trend towards social progressivism, where people are genuinely becoming more open-minded and less spiteful about differences. A lot of people across the country, on the coasts or in its vast interior, many of whom would not even be remotely considered woke or familiar with the jargon, turned out in the streets for George Floyd. A decade or so ago, they would have been content to privately condemn the officer in polite company but stayed off of the streets altogether. 

I would also add that wokeness is also genuinely an innovation to progressive politics. It is no coincidence that I cited examples from queer and trans rights activism when trying to explain the phenomenon. I don’t think it could have emerged except as a respond to the rise of those movements, and the need to position them organically within the broader coalition for social justice. Like any new thing, it will draw on elements and jargon from older left-wing political and academic traditions, which leads critics to pin its origins on post-modernism, critical theory, the Frankfurt School, political correctly, the Cultural Revolution, or what-have-you. However, these explanations fail to explain why this highly recognizable phenomenon came about so rapidly in the 2010s rather than in the 1960s or any other era of left-wing college activism.

## The Tumblr Hypothesis

Enter the [Tumblr hypothesis](https://americanmind.org/salvo/tumblr-u/), presented by Katherine Dee (better known as Default Friend on Twitter), which basically pins the origin of wokeness on Tumblr. The chronology checks out. Both emerged in the 2010s. It struck me in its simplicity—I do like me a parisimonious theory—and inspired this whole essay in response. I have to admit that I was initially skeptical.

But then I thought about an online conversation I had witnessed once among anti-police protesters at the height of tensions in the summer of 2020. There were real stakes, given that police were definitely surveilling the exchanged and arrest was a constant worry in their IRL activities. These guys talked the anarchist talk and walked the anarchist walk. But occasionally, they would start comforting each other, reminding each other to self-care. And now and then, one of the accounts with a furry profile picture would chime in.

While the above image might jar with existing conceptions about what black bloc anarchists look like, it is instantly recognizable to anyone who frequented Tumblr in its heyday. It is as if a community, who were first exposed to politics and social life on an online space, simply retained that vibe and aesthetic when trying to build real-life spaces. Given how online every one is nowadays, this is not too much of a stretch.

And there is more to the Tumblr hypothesis. The idea is that Tumblr was the platform that brought activists together organically with non-activists. To look at a Tumblr feed was to scroll through activist posts, personal confessions, and fandom. Non-activists may not have posted their own activist messages, but they almost certainly reblogged it.

> Academia doesn’t exactly pull a crowd, but do you know what does? Media properties like One Direction, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, *Supernatural*, *Steven Universe*, and Harry Potter.
>
> Tumblr’s interface made it particularly easy to share and remix content—meaning streams between fandoms and niches was a hallmark of the website. In other words, popular media content that was going to go viral anyway regularly had activist messaging appended to it.

The graduates of Tumblr brought their particular habits and aesthetics to college campuses, not the other way around. Moreover, the rise of Tumblr fed a burgeoning clickbait industry, propelling it into the mainstream.

> You have a dual problem of writers needing content and going to increasingly obscure sources to procure it, *and* people strip mining their own lives for content in the service of having an audience read their “personal essays.”
>
> What do either of these have to do with what the identity politics landscape has become? Both Tumblr and digital publications like Vice, Buzzfeed, Jezebel, Bust, and Rookie (to name just a few) had a *much* wider reach than academic literature, or even activist groups. You were much more likely to encounter a bastardized interpretation of the meaning of “emotional labor” on your Tumblr feed, or a Vice article regurgitating that Tumblr post, than you were in a classroom.
>
> Once something is trending online, it’s fair game for a struggling publication, particularly if it lends itself to a catchy, clickable title.
>
> Even early news articles about topics like “privilege,” or even “trigger warnings,” reference their ubiquity in online spaces, as opposed to within academic ones.
>
> Take [this](https://theconversation.com/silver-linings-and-trigger-warnings-12111) article 2013 article at *The Conversation* about trigger warnings. Writer Lauren Rosewarne, a lecturer at the University of Melbourne, describes them as “used mostly on-line to head up discussions of topics like sexual violence, depression or self-mutilation.” It was not a term popular in academia, in activism, nor one that originated in a psychiatric setting for sufferers of PTSD.

I really like the Tumblr hypothesis because it’s concrete where other hypotheses about the rise of wokeness are vague and insinuatory of academic obscurities few have ever read. Also, it confirms my suspicions that college kids are far more likely to share copypasta memes about academic themes, rather than be directly radicalized by reading theory. It’s also falsifiable, in that I could conceivably trawl through the corpus of all Tumblr posts and metadata, and then surveyed all Tumblr users about their platform usage and political engagement over time, to either prove or put this hypothesis to bed.

Without the means to prove this hypothesis, well, it just makes a lot of sense?

The proliferation of marginalized identities is analogous to the proliferation of micro-identities on the internet. Everyone was weirdly obsessive about some particular fandom and you just needed to accept that as a normal thing, because, heck you were part of some micro-community as well. The internet also encouraged the constant exploration of narrower and narrower subcultures and subgenres in anything imaginable. A sort of over-enthusiastic brand of tolerance runs rampant online. What appears as a hyper-uncomfortable blurring of boundaries between highly personal affairs and politics to other people, is instantly familiar to any young teen who was hearing about sex from anonymous Tumblrinas on the internet or reading the dime-a-dozen personal essays from the personal writing mills. Callout culture and constant self-affirmation makes a lot of sense in decentralized circles—internet or activist—because mere speech is often the only remedy you have at your disposal.

I want to be careful here. Because at this point, one might be inclined to infer that wokeness is when a bunch of weirdly online fans ended up adopting politics as their new fandom. 

What I am arguing here is something far more specific. A generation of people, of varying participation or even mere passive observation of online culture, were first presented with certain elements in a specific online context (that of Tumblr and the clickbait media industry it spawned) and ended up being highly receptive when those elements were presented later  in an explicitly political context in slightly altered form. Some of them were ex-Tumblrinas, but I’m sure a lot of them weren’t.

And once there was a critical mass of them (it doesn’t actually require a lot of people to shift the conversation and there were a LOT of millenials on Tumblr) and media backing, they had a definite shift on the political atmosphere. These things grow exponentially, and now there are Zoomers, who became woke on TikTok or Twitter or whichever platform has supplanted Tumblr at this point.

## Conclusion

Like any framework, actually existing wokeness does have its blind spots and unresolved questions, many of which are also obvious to its proponents.

When personal experience cannot be rejected and is always valid, how do you deal with dissent?

How does one co-exist with non-marginalized identities?

How should woke pro-capitalist liberals engage with woke anti-capitalists? 

How does one deal with corporate or political actors who cynically invoke identity to justify their ends? No one is fooled when the CIA flies the rainbow flag on its social media account. But if you genuinely believe the struggle for material improvement is inseparable from cultural representation, with neither to be sacrificed for the other, how do you react when a corporation offers genuine improvements in the diversity of its white-collar cadres while continuing to exploit its blue-collar workforce?

The focus on a cultural realm and cultural criticism can sap the energy that could be channeled into more tangible struggles. The blurring of the general and the particular is a poetic conceit I am partial to in literature, but one that does not map well to real life. Amid the cultural wars, embracing identity often means making enemies of potential allies who are economically progressive but don’t like the other stuff. 

I try not to dismiss anyone’s political trajectory. If we look through the arc of history, political consciousness is a pretty arbitrary process. The leaders of a nascent movement might have just been in the same unit at the military academy, or some reading circle. My own political identity was formed in part by watching suggested YouTube videos and reading investing blogs. It is hard to summon the activation energy to get involved. Many of us don’t vote because (aside from the rare minority whose political positions expressly forbid voting) we rightfully perceive that the system doesn’t really care about us. But however we get inspired to get involved, we should always look back and see if the framework we inherited can be improved upon.

If we look at the history of the synthesis of Christian faith and politics, it is pretty sordid and bloody. Yet, it would be negligently to dismiss the mixture of deeply-held faith and politics as just a dangerous mix of passions to be avoid.

I would still consider myself not woke, in that I hold to more traditional notions of building solidarity that don’t explicitly center identity, even if I do check the boxes on the progressive social views. But I would still like to ask, is it possible to retain the potency of woke identity politics, the union of social progressivism and deep personal experience, while resolving some of its deadlocks?

I do think wokeness, specifically its emphasis on identity, is here to stay, especially in activist circles. And given its persistence, I think it is a losing proposition to stay angry or fearful of it. I would prefer to be a-sleep. ZZZ.
