# The Greek noun “archegos”

Found just four times in the New Testament ([Acts 3:15](https://biblia.com/bible/asv/Acts 3.15); [5:31](https://biblia.com/bible/asv/Acts 5.31); [Heb. 2:10](https://biblia.com/bible/asv/Heb. 2.10); [12:2](https://biblia.com/bible/asv/Heb 12.2)), and used “exclusively as a christological title for the exalted Jesus” (Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament, 1:163), the Greek noun “*archegos*” meant “author,” “prince,” “captain,” “leader,” “beginner.”

Jesus is the “one who leads the way to life” ([Acts 3:15](https://biblia.com/bible/asv/Acts 3.15)). He is also man’s “Leader” and Savior ([Acts 5:31](https://biblia.com/bible/asv/Acts 5.31)). He is the “pioneer” of our salvation ([Heb. 2:10](https://biblia.com/bible/asv/Heb. 2.10)). In [Heb. 12:2](https://biblia.com/bible/asv/Heb. 12.2) He is pictured as the “leader of the faith in order to encourage believers to endure in their christological life of faith” (ibid, p. 164).
