{% newthought 'FEBRUARY 27, 1968' %}

“If I’ve lost Cronkite, I’ve lost Middle America,” President Lyndon Johnson was said to have remarked after watching the night’s CBS Evening News broadcast.

Like many Americans, Johnson had been tuning in regularly to the First Television War, then in its latest season: the Tet Offensive. The offensive marked a departure from the interminable guerrilla warfare that had plagued American GIs since their involvement in what was once French Indochina. The series of Communist attacks on South Vietnamese cities and military bases had come out of seemingly nowhere, catching the US military off its guard and jeopardizing Johnson’s chances at a second term. As if that weren’t enough, the most authoritative newsman of the time,  Walter Cronkite, had just broadcast his doubts about the whole affair, decisively ending public support for the war.

>  For it seems now more certain than ever, that the bloody experience of Vietnam is to end in a stalemate.
>
> …
>
> To say that we are closer to victory today is to believe, in the face of the evidence, the optimists who have been wrong in the past. To suggest we are on the edge of defeat is to yield to unreasonable pessimism. To say that we are mired in stalemate seems the only realistic, yet unsatisfactory, conclusion.

 {% marginnote 'mn-id-1' '[W. Joseph Campbell on the myth of the Cronkite Moment](https://mediamythalert.com/category/cronkite-moment/)' '' %} 

The idea of a *Cronkite Moment* is too good to pass up—Cronkite DESTROYS Johnson’s War with FACTS and LOGIC!—as a self-congratulatory account of the power of media delivered by one of its own. But Johnson was not sitting in front of his television that night. He was celebrating the birthday of his ally, Governor John Connally. Nor did Cronkite say anything in his three-minute closing statement that was not already mentioned in previous reports. Suggestions of a stalemate had appeared in the press months before the first shots of the Tet Offensive were fired, and public opinion was souring even prior to late February. The Cronkite Moment, as we collectively remember it, never happened.

However, there was a moment that we collectively forgot about, which did happen two weeks later. 

>  The war is being lost by the administration’s definition.
>
> {% cite 'Frank McGee' 'NBC News' '(March 10, 1968)' %}

This was the bold media condemnation of the war that we imagined Cronkite’s address to be, except delivered by a rival news network. But it is this inconsistency in our collective memory—remembering a Cronkite but not a McGee Moment—that is, in my opinion, the definitive proof that some version of a Cronkite Moment truly occurred and recovers the essence of the myth.

{% newthought 'If you were an astute, pro-war observer at the time, ' %} you may have wondered why the American media were doing the work of North Vietnamese propagandists for them. As bleak as the footage from Saigon, Huế, and Khe Sanh looked, the Allied forces stationed in South Vietnam were fully capable of absorbing the renewed attack of the North Vietnamese army and its guerrilla allies, the Viet Cong. The commentary and the video failed to capture the true context of the situation.

The ambitious assault playing out on American television screens in early 1968—the first phase of the Tet Offensive—was stretched far too thin. The whole venture reeked of desperation. Contrary to the official narrative, even factions within the North Vietnamese leadership had their misgivings about the plan. The dubious premise of the offensive was to spark a popular uprising against the American-backed South Vietnamese regime. What resulted was the virtual annihilation of the Viet Cong, leaving the North Vietnamese Army to fight the remainder of the war mostly by itself. During the fighting, the Viet Cong also endeared no one to their cause with atrocities such as the Huế massacre, which eliminated 5–10% of the city’s population.

Even without knowing the intentions of the enemy, you could predict that a hitherto successful guerrilla force would immolate itself once it embarked on a conventional assault against ample Allied firepower simply based on a raw assessment of each sides’ capabilities. The non-guerrilla part would fare better but still be repulsed. That the footage of South Vietnamese positions being overrun was being cited as evidence of losing the war or negotiations being the only option—a lazy and convenient narrative in your opinion—would have been beyond aggravating for you.

You see a decisive military victory—not looming defeat—on the horizon.

Yet even with facts and logic on your side, there was no way you could explain how, *well actually*, the Tet Offensive was a positive turning point amid the indecisive slog of attrition and guerrilla action, without somehow admitting that the Johnson administration was lying through its teeth about the progress of the war. If the military planners were to be believed, the previous years of attrition should have rendered a Tet Offensive-like operation impossible. 

Here we can appreciate the power of Cronkite’s words. In his three minutes, he offers to accept the administration’s judgment on military affairs.

> They may be right, that Hanoi's winter-spring offensive has been forced by the Communist realization that they could not win the longer war of attrition, and that the Communists hope that any success in the offensive will improve their position for eventual negotiations.

> On the off chance that military and political analysts are right, in the next few months we must test the enemy's intentions, in case this is indeed his last big gasp before negotiations.

And concludes that even if they are right, they are still wrong. 

> But it is increasingly clear to this reporter that the only rational way out then will be to negotiate, not as victors, but as an honorable people who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy, and did the best they could.

Partially scripted and partially thinking out loud, Cronkite’s role was to act out a reasonable observer’s sober reaction to the events around him. Within the theater of television, he did not say anything the public did not already know. Rather, he  was speaking for them. He gave voice to the private doubts they suspected were true (reflected in public opinion polling), and converted private knowledge into common knowledge. Without calling Johnson a liar, he made it no longer reasonable to accept Johnson’s lies or to insist on further fighting over negotiation. That is why Cronkite’s measured response is better remembered and more transgressive than McGee’s far bolder statement against the war. McGee was simply moving into the opening left by the man before him.

I do not believe that the Cronkite Moment set in motion a self-fulfilling prophecy that altered circumstances on the ground in Southeast Asia. Rather, it seeded the misinterpretation of an event—the public’s misguided{% sidenote 'mn-id-1' 'Cronkite was quite clear-eyed about the military outcome. He correctly anticipated the fall of Khe Sanh Combat Base, and the fallout accompanying it. “**Khe Sanh could well fall, with a terrible loss in American lives, prestige and morale, and this is a tragedy of our stubbornness there; but the bastion no longer is a key to the rest of the northern regions, and it is doubtful that the American forces can be defeated across the breadth of the DMZ with any substantial loss of ground.**” For the purposes of this essay, I assume that the median American viewer was less clear-eyed about the future and panicking over the news, because that illustrates my point on how they can be “wrong” but ultimately “right.” As a neat metaphor, after the Americans retook Khe Sanh, they promptly abandoned it because the combat had rendered the place unusable.' '' %} view of the military outcome of the Tet Offensive—in order for the American public to realize a deeper truth. The Vietnam War, as it was sold and promoted by official lies, would not be won—*should not be won*. Thus, the Tet Offensive is remembered in every history textbook as a clear American military victory, but also a turning point against the Americans, even though the war would not officially end until seven years later. 



The impact of historical events is sometimes crystal-clear when they happen, except to those who know too much, i.e., too quick to debunk “myths.” In those cases, the truth is better reflected in narrative than in facts. But it requires a careful eye to discern the historically relevant dimensions of propaganda, especially if the elements of the narrative are extremely divorced from reality.

And sometimes, the propaganda is mindblowingly—almost intentionally—stupid.

{% newthought 'Once upon a time,' %} a group of small investors rose up against malevolent, short-selling hedge funds who were determined to crush a vulnerable retailer. Organizing in the battlespace of capital markets, the guerrilla smallholders applied their ingenuity (buying call options to force a gamma squeeze) and persistence (“diamond hands”) to engineer a short squeeze in the stock price of the retailer to bankrupt the hedge funds. Victory was almost in hand, until the brokers suddenly restricted stock and options purchases, promptly sending the stock price into a downward spiral in order to protect the hedge funds. {% newthought 'The End.' %}

hopes and dreams,

The GME squeeze is a self-immolative act, but it's not an effete act of rebellion. It's easy to either pigeonhole this as some technical plumbing story about brokerages and clearinghouses or a pump-and-dump, which are both "true" in some literal sense.

But if the endgame means that GME is forcibly shut down through regulatory or institutional measures, the story meaningfully shifts.

It's not that nefarious actors are scamming retail (they are but that's not the real point).

It's that the system is so set up that whenever retail gets an edge, most of the edge is first front-runned away and then when retail tries to collect on the last morsel, they are shut out.


As FinTwit residents, we all know this. But there is a symbolic importance in not just seeing it, but revealing it. Per your latest tweets, CNBC is dead in the water. 

If capital markets are an extremely stupid way to expression disaffection with the system, that's kind of the point.

This is the game we were told we were supposed to play. And so we will play it by the book to prove to you that you don't even believe in your own rules.

That's a more subversive critique of capitalism than a standard leftist one. This narrative is going to stick and the damage to capital markets far exceeds the billions that shorts lost on GME.

I'm soapboxing a little, because I surmise that you probably don't disagree that there is a potential narrative impact of this, still think the "sticking it to the man" is hilarious and patently ridiculous.

The feminist law professors{% sidenote 'mn-id-1' 'Janet Halley, Jeannie Suk Gersen, Elizabeth Bartholet, and Nancy Gertner.' %} who spoke out against this new sex bureaucracy also noted that it went well beyond addressing perceived misconduct to also policing normal sexual conduct.

> Yale University disclosed in its required 2013 ASR that its prevention program tells students that **consent is not enough:** ‘Hold out for enthusiasm. In general, it’s easy to tell if someone is enthusiastic about an encounter or not.‘ In complying with the prevention program disclosure requirement, and purporting to prevent nonconsensual sexual contact, Yale instructs students on enthusiastic sex. Students are told to ‘[c]ommunicate with [their] sexual and romantic partners,’ as ‘[o]pen discussion of desires and limits is a critical part of building a positive sexual culture.’ A positive sexual culture, open discussion of sexual desires, communication with romantic partners, and enthusiastic sex all seem like good sexual aspirations, though perhaps achieved by quite few. But these are not trainings about how to prevent sexual violence. **They are instructions on how to have ordinary (or extraordinary) sex, and they are produced and monitored by the sex bureaucracy.**
> {% cite 'Jacob Gersen & Jeannie Suk' '[The Sex Bureaucracy,](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2750143)' '(California Law Review)' %}

If the harm of sexual violence is so terrible, is it then acceptable to nudge behavior across the spectrum, even if it is normal, in the hopes that it may reduce violence at the margin? The degree to which college administrators should provide sex tips to young adults merits thoughtful discussion from both a legal and a personal liberties perspective. However, the more practical question, left unanswered by most writing on the subject, is to simply ask how effective all these policies were in actually changing behavior. Certainly the students who dealt with the tribunals firsthand would never forget their experiences, but they would only be a small minority. For the remainder of the student body, their only direct contact with the sex bureaucracy would be emails reminding them to watch videos or review updated bulletins. While these efforts can set norms for appropriate behavior, their guidelines can really only be enforced through the students themselves, by obeying or reporting their partners for non-compliance. And as a psychological matter, can mere rules really reshape the nature of our desires—what we seek through sex that we would not freely admit to anyone, except perhaps a search bar? 

> Everything in the world is about sex, except sex. Sex is about power.

{% newthought It is perhaps, %} that one of the reasons we need a robust, sex bureaucracy is to regulate the destructive notions we acquire through pornography.

We are living in a new sex bureaucracy. Saliently decriminalized in the past decades, sex has at the same time become accountable to bureaucracy. In this Article, we focus on higher education to tell the story of the sex bureaucracy. The story is about the steady expansion of regulatory concepts of sex discrimination and sexual violence to the point that the regulated domain comes to encompass ordinary sex. The mark of bureaucracy is procedure and organizational form. Over time, federal prohibitions against sex discrimination and sexual violence have been interpreted to require educational institutions to adopt particular procedures to respond, prevent, research, survey, inform, investigate, adjudicate, and train.The federal bureaucracy required nongovernmental institutions to create mini-bureaucracies, and to develop policies and procedures that are subject to federal oversight. That oversight is not merely, as currently assumed, of sexual harassment and sexual violence, but also of sex itself. We call this bureaucratic sex creep—the enlargement of bureaucratic regulation of sexual conduct that is voluntary, non-harassing, nonviolent, and does not harm others. At a moment when it is politically difficult to criticize any undertaking against sexual assault, we are writing about the bureaucratic leveraging of sexual violence and harassment policy to regulate ordinary sex. An object of our critique is the bureaucratic tendency to merge sexual violence and sexual harassment with ordinary sex, and thus to trivialize a very serious problem. We worry that the sex bureaucracy is counterproductive to the goal of actually addressing the harms of rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment. Our purpose is to guide the reader through the landscape of the sex bureaucracy so that its development and workings can be known and debated.

How is a bureaucracy built?

A bureaucracy is more than a collection of people in an office.

For a bureaucracy to sustain itself, it needs nourishment from the outside, which it obtains from intervening in the everyday life of people who exist outside of it.

Sex, in its typical form, involves none of the above.



At first glance, the minimal requirements of sex—two or more consenting adults and a little bit of privacy—leave l ittle room for outside intrusion. As long as sexual activity avoids financial transactions, the use of public property, or any domain that summons the state’s attention, it exists outside the realm of regulation.

 that serve as entry points through which the external bureaucracy of the state can intervene.

In cases such as sex, the state cannot emerge de novo like the Kool-Aid man when invoked. Rather, it must be invited like a vampire, into the bedroom.

The hardest part of regulating sex is enforcement. The basic requirements for sex—two consenting individuals—are minimal.





Desire will always breed a desire to regulate it.

There is always a desire to regulate desire itself. Among all the types of desire, sex proves elusive. Its basic requirements are minimal, the consent of two motivated humans.

The hardest part of regulating sex is enforcement. The minimal requirements of sex are two bodies and a bit of privacy. It does not typically involve dangerous objects (motorized vehicles, firearms, hazardous waste), use of government property (federal lands, embassies), the financial system (equity derivatives, cryptocurrency) or any of the talismans which serve as an entry point for the state to intervene. The liberalization of law has made it difficult to invoke any generic sense of public decency and morality.

Where regular sex can still be regulated is through the prevention of sexual assault. As feminist scholars noted, in teh wake of a very real need to combat rape on college campuses, colleges evolved a sex bureaucracy. This bureaucracy was not a metaphor, but a real collective of different legal.



the state , like a vampire, always needs to be invited in.

Still this was a regulation of sex within the regimented environment of a college campus. As terrible as it was for those caught at the wrong end of it, I’m not sure if those outside of teh direct sanctions ever noticed it. Sure they may have watched several videos about consent, thought it helpful or laughable, and proceeded along with their campus life.

And even within the framework of the sex bureaucracy, the entry point of the state/quasi-state is another human being—your partner. In that moment in your dorm room, it is not the state who judge consent but rather your partner lying beside you. It’s you and them.

When we imagine the state in the bedroom we have this cartoonish totalitarian view of direct surveillance. Some futuristic dystopia where we book a room after both sides’ lawyers sign teh contracts, and the act is performed in clear view of mutliple cameras, where a lawyer can invoke priivlege for breach of contract at any time. It’s a voyeuristic view.

But this reality already exists. For many single people, the very act of sexual enjoyment is tied to bureaucracy. The procedure goes something like this. They slot out a private moment to enjoy themselves, during which they log on to a centralized database and query it with the appropriate tags to search for a file. So among the generic content, produced by, in many cases, poorly paid, literally faceless functionaries.  After the document is opened and processed, at the end the data is stored to the database to generate recommendations, which other functionaries of this bureaucracy may use to generate more generic files.
