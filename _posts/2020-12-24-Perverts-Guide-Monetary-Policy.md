{% newthought 'To an adolescent,' %} pornography first appears as a substitute for sex—a digital e-cig to the analog cigarette. Jarring and filmed at uncomfortable angles, smut is the bootlegged copy of the “real deal” denied. It is enjoyed secretly, in equal parts of excitement and disappointment, as a young mind ponders its place in the relational universe. But for those who have experienced both, even this bootlegged promise fails to hold. Pornography is not sex. Nor has it ever pretended to be, except as a half-hearted parody.

Yet to dismiss pornography as a failed simulation is to miss the point. Whether or not one is disgusted or pleased by Picasso’s mutilation of form (I’m partial to the one shown above), his intentional distortion should never be seen as an inferior imitation of some original female figure. The sacrifice of realism is deliberate: In return for the loss of resemblance, the painter acquires something exciting. Similarly, it is only through disillusionment—the realization of the fundamental difference between smut and sex—that we understand the true appeal of pornography. It too offers a trade, wherein an experience whose pleasure derives intrinsically from imagination and risk—from intimacy and vulnerability—is exchanged for a standardized procedure providing a predictable payoff. 

**The essence of pornography is thus, bureaucracy.**

Consider humans who, in search of outlets for their desire, seek not other humans but instead schedule private appointments in front of specialized terminals. Positioned before screens, they access a centralized database, a hub of pornography as it were, to browse for the appropriate files to fulfill their need. Files that have been prepared and indexed by the network of anonymous, often entirely faceless, functionaries who contribute to this repository. In these interactions, the role of the intimate companion is replaced by the role of an impersonal, decentralized sex bureaucracy that collects viewing data in order to structure future recommendations and content curation accordingly.

{% newthought 'When we think of regulation,' %} we usually think about external bureaucracies that are imposed onto us. For example, the term **sex bureaucracy**, as used in a [California Law Review article](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=457081120069123064122097002016120119000082066008011028071110115102083078094012110071029048028008114049015107109064112022108066040008075040031065111030068109118093051081091069069024065125070103019118107019084104126079119081005122024069125024004008004&EXT=pdf) of the same name, explicitly refers to the ecosystem of administrative organizations designed to police sexual misconduct on college campuses. These structures emerged after 2011 in response to a Dear Colleague Letter issuing new federal guidelines on Title IX concerning sex discrimination that expanded the obligations of schools to proactively root out misconduct. This updated guidance, in conjunction with (completely correct!) social pressure to reduce sexual harassment and violence, served as the basis of a system of tribunals to adjudicate sexual allegations.

From its conception, this parallel justice system was [plagued with problems](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/arts-letters/articles/americas-new-sex-bureaucracy). It adopted bizarre standards and denied due process to those accused, which eventually led to lawsuits against schools filed through the actual legal system.

> It required investigators to start by believing accusers (rather than starting from a place of impartial neutrality), instructed them against using a “reasonable person” test to constrain their judgment of whether sexual conduct regarded as unwelcome constitutes harassment or assault, and required them to reach a finding of wrongdoing if they felt confidence that misconduct had occurred greater than **50+1 percent**. 
>
> {% cite 'Wesley Yang' '[America’s New Sex Bureaucracy](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/arts-letters/articles/americas-new-sex-bureaucracy)' '' %}

The feminist law professors {% sidenote 'mn-id-1' 'Janet Halley, Jeannie Suk Gersen, Elizabeth Bartholet, and Nancy Gertner.' %} who spoke out against this new sex bureaucracy also noted that it went well beyond addressing perceived misconduct to also policing normal sexual conduct.

> Yale University disclosed in its required 2013 ASR that its prevention program tells students that **consent is not enough:** ‘Hold out for enthusiasm. In general, it’s easy to tell if someone is enthusiastic about an encounter or not.‘ In complying with the prevention program disclosure requirement, and purporting to prevent nonconsensual sexual contact, Yale instructs students on enthusiastic sex. Students are told to ‘[c]ommunicate with [their] sexual and romantic partners,’ as ‘[o]pen discussion of desires and limits is a critical part of building a positive sexual culture.’ A positive sexual culture, open discussion of sexual desires, communication with romantic partners, and enthusiastic sex all seem like good sexual aspirations, though perhaps achieved by quite few. But these are not trainings about how to prevent sexual violence. **They are instructions on how to have ordinary (or extraordinary) sex, and they are produced and monitored by the sex bureaucracy.**

If the harm of sexual violence is so terrible, is it then acceptable to nudge behavior across the spectrum, even if it is normal, in the hopes that it may reduce violence at the margin? The degree to which college administrators should provide sex tips to young adults merits thoughtful discussion from both a legal and a personal liberties perspective. However, the more practical question, left unanswered by most writing on the subject, is to simply ask how effective all these policies were in actually changing behavior. Certainly the students who dealt with the tribunals firsthand would never forget their experiences, but they would only be a small minority. For the vast remainder of the student body, their only contact with the sex bureaucracy are emails reminding them to watch videos or review updated bulletins. While these effort set norms for appropriate behavior, these guidelines can only be enforced insofar as either partner obeys or reports the other for violating them. And as a psychological matter, can mere rules really reshape the nature of our desires—what we seek through sex that we would not freely admit to anyone except for an omniscient search bar?

{% newthought 'There are two types of (explicit) financial regulation.' %} Rules with real-world consequences, those that set capital ratios for banks or punish insider trading for example, versus rules that only incur personal consequences when some ritualized disclosure, box-ticking, or paper-shuffling is not faithfully carried out. One could argue, like the soft and hard ends of the sex bureaucracy, they constitute the encroachment of the state, through the  **SEC** and **CFTC**,{% marginnote 'mn-id-1' 'Security and Exchanges Commission (**SEC**) & Commodity Futures Trading Commission (**CFTC**)' '' %} into everyday financial life.

Yet those agencies are far from the most powerful organization on campus. Not by a long shot.

We are living in a new sex bureaucracy. Saliently decriminalized in the past decades, sex has at the same time become accountable to bureaucracy. In this Article, we focus on higher education to tell the story of the sex bureaucracy. The story is about the steady expansion of regulatory concepts of sex discrimination and sexual violence to the point that the regulated domain comes to encompass ordinary sex. The mark of bureaucracy is procedure and organizational form. Over time, federal prohibitions against sex discrimination and sexual violence have been interpreted to require educational institutions to adopt particular procedures to respond, prevent, research, survey, inform, investigate, adjudicate, and train.The federal bureaucracy required nongovernmental institutions to create mini-bureaucracies, and to develop policies and procedures that are subject to federal oversight. That oversight is not merely, as currently assumed, of sexual harassment and sexual violence, but also of sex itself. We call this bureaucratic sex creep—the enlargement of bureaucratic regulation of sexual conduct that is voluntary, non-harassing, nonviolent, and does not harm others. At a moment when it is politically difficult to criticize any undertaking against sexual assault, we are writing about the bureaucratic leveraging of sexual violence and harassment policy to regulate ordinary sex. An object of our critique is the bureaucratic tendency to merge sexual violence and sexual harassment with ordinary sex, and thus to trivialize a very serious problem. We worry that the sex bureaucracy is counterproductive to the goal of actually addressing the harms of rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment. Our purpose is to guide the reader through the landscape of the sex bureaucracy so that its development and workings can be known and debated.

The foundation A bureaucracy always requires an entry point.

“Oh, Yeah!” The Kool-Aid Man appear



Sex, in its typical form, involves none of the above.



At first glance, the minimal requirements of sex—two or more consenting adults and a little bit of privacy—leave l ittle room for outside intrusion. As long as sexual activity avoids financial transactions, the use of public property, or any domain that summons the state’s attention, it exists outside the realm of regulation.

 that serve as entry points through which the external bureaucracy of the state can intervene.

In cases such as sex, the state cannot emerge de novo like the Kool-Aid man when invoked. Rather, it must be invited like a vampire, into the bedroom.

The hardest part of regulating sex is enforcement. The basic requirements for sex—two consenting individuals—are minimal.





Desire will always breed a desire to regulate it.

There is always a desire to regulate desire itself. Among all the types of desire, sex proves elusive. Its basic requirements are minimal, the consent of two motivated humans.

The hardest part of regulating sex is enforcement. The minimal requirements of sex are two bodies and a bit of privacy. It does not typically involve dangerous objects (motorized vehicles, firearms, hazardous waste), use of government property (federal lands, embassies), the financial system (equity derivatives, cryptocurrency) or any of the talismans which serve as an entry point for the state to intervene. The liberalization of law has made it difficult to invoke any generic sense of public decency and morality.

Where regular sex can still be regulated is through the prevention of sexual assault. As feminist scholars noted, in teh wake of a very real need to combat rape on college campuses, colleges evolved a sex bureaucracy. This bureaucracy was not a metaphor, but a real collective of different legal.



the state , like a vampire, always needs to be invited in.

Still this was a regulation of sex within the regimented environment of a college campus. As terrible as it was for those caught at the wrong end of it, I’m not sure if those outside of teh direct sanctions ever noticed it. Sure they may have watched several videos about consent, thought it helpful or laughable, and proceeded along with their campus life.

And even within the framework of the sex bureaucracy, the entry point of the state/quasi-state is another human being—your partner. In that moment in your dorm room, it is not the state who judge consent but rather your partner lying beside you. It’s you and them.

When we imagine the state in the bedroom we have this cartoonish totalitarian view of direct surveillance. Some futuristic dystopia where we book a room after both sides’ lawyers sign teh contracts, and the act is performed in clear view of mutliple cameras, where a lawyer can invoke priivlege for breach of contract at any time. It’s a voyeuristic view.

But this reality already exists. For many single people, the very act of sexual enjoyment is tied to bureaucracy. The procedure goes something like this. They slot out a private moment to enjoy themselves, during which they log on to a centralized database and query it with the appropriate tags to search for a file. So among the generic content, produced by, in many cases, poorly paid, literally faceless functionaries.  After the document is opened and processed, at the end the data is stored to the database to generate recommendations, which other functionaries of this bureaucracy may use to generate more generic files.
