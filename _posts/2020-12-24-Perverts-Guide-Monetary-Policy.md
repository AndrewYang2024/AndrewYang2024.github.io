To an adolescent, pornography first appears as a substitute for sex—a digital e-cig to the analog cigarette—made of equal parts joy and disappointment. Smut is the bootlegged copy of the “real” thing; it is jarring, filmed at uncomfortable angles, and enjoyed secretly as a young adult sketches out their place in the world. {% marginnote 'mn-id-1' 'Singular they is how I roll' %}

 a schema which, may not be possible to realize in full, but neverthless the only one.

The genius of porno

The true promise of pornography is to trade an activity whose pleasure is intrinsically linked to risk, that of being vulnerable, in exchange for a procedure with a predictable payoff.

That is to say, the essence of pornography is the bureaucratization of desire.

The sex bureaucracy is more than a fanciful metaphor. The term was coined in a California Law Review article of the same name. 





otherwise, the accountability is precisely that the premise is 





We are living in a new sex bureaucracy. Saliently decriminalized in the past decades, sex has at the same time become accountable to bureaucracy. In this Article, we focus on higher education to tell the story of the sex bureaucracy. The story is about the steady expansion of regulatory concepts of sex discrimination and sexual violence to the point that the regulated domain comes to encompass ordinary sex. The mark of bureaucracy is procedure and organizational form. Over time, federal prohibitions against sex discrimination and sexual violence have been interpreted to require educational institutions to adopt particular procedures to respond, prevent, research, survey, inform, investigate, adjudicate, and train.The federal bureaucracy required nongovernmental institutions to create mini-bureaucracies, and to develop policies and procedures that are subject to federal oversight. That oversight is not merely, as currently assumed, of sexual harassment and sexual violence, but also of sex itself. We call this bureaucratic sex creep—the enlargement of bureaucratic regulation of sexual conduct that is voluntary, non-harassing, nonviolent, and does not harm others. At a moment when it is politically difficult to criticize any undertaking against sexual assault, we are writing about the bureaucratic leveraging of sexual violence and harassment policy to regulate ordinary sex. An object of our critique is the bureaucratic tendency to merge sexual violence and sexual harassment with ordinary sex, and thus to trivialize a very serious problem. We worry that the sex bureaucracy is counterproductive to the goal of actually addressing the harms of rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment. Our purpose is to guide the reader through the landscape of the sex bureaucracy so that its development and workings can be known and debated.

How is a bureaucracy built?

A bureaucracy is more than a collection of people in an office.

For a bureaucracy to sustain itself, it needs nourishment from the outside, which it obtains from intervening in the everyday life of people who exist outside of it.

Otherwise, the bureaucracy exists as the grown-up version of playing House or holding a tea party.

 It’s not just a matter of shuffling a group of paper-pushers inside an office tower.

The foundation A bureaucracy always requires an entry point.

“Oh, Yeah!” The Kool-Aid Man appear



Sex, in its typical form, involves none of the above.



At first glance, the minimal requirements of sex—two or more consenting adults and a little bit of privacy—leave l ittle room for outside intrusion. As long as sexual activity avoids financial transactions, the use of public property, or any domain that summons the state’s attention, it exists outside the realm of regulation.

 that serve as entry points through which the external bureaucracy of the state can intervene.

In cases such as sex, the state cannot emerge de novo like the Kool-Aid man when invoked. Rather, it must be invited like a vampire, into the bedroom.



In case, you think this is a thought exercise. to describe what they saw an an emergent complex to regulate, not but normal sex.

The hardest part of regulating sex is enforcement. The basic requirements for sex—two consenting individuals—are minimal.





Desire will always breed a desire to regulate it.

There is always a desire to regulate desire itself. Among all the types of desire, sex proves elusive. Its basic requirements are minimal, the consent of two motivated humans.

The hardest part of regulating sex is enforcement. The minimal requirements of sex are two bodies and a bit of privacy. It does not typically involve dangerous objects (motorized vehicles, firearms, hazardous waste), use of government property (federal lands, embassies), the financial system (equity derivatives, cryptocurrency) or any of the talismans which serve as an entry point for the state to intervene. The liberalization of law has made it difficult to invoke any generic sense of public decency and morality.

Where regular sex can still be regulated is through the prevention of sexual assault. As feminist scholars noted, in teh wake of a very real need to combat rape on college campuses, colleges evolved a sex bureaucracy. This bureaucracy was not a metaphor, but a real collective of different legal.



the state , like a vampire, always needs to be invited in.

Still this was a regulation of sex within the regimented environment of a college campus. As terrible as it was for those caught at the wrong end of it, I’m not sure if those outside of teh direct sanctions ever noticed it. Sure they may have watched several videos about consent, thought it helpful or laughable, and proceeded along with their campus life.

And even within the framework of the sex bureaucracy, the entry point of the state/quasi-state is another human being—your partner. In that moment in your dorm room, it is not the state who judge consent but rather your partner lying beside you. It’s you and them.

When we imagine the state in the bedroom we have this cartoonish totalitarian view of direct surveillance. Some futuristic dystopia where we book a room after both sides’ lawyers sign teh contracts, and the act is performed in clear view of mutliple cameras, where a lawyer can invoke priivlege for breach of contract at any time. It’s a voyeuristic view.

But this reality already exists. For many single people, the very act of sexual enjoyment is tied to bureaucracy. The procedure goes something like this. They slot out a private moment to enjoy themselves, during which they log on to a centralized database and query it with the appropriate tags to search for a file. So among the generic content, produced by, in many cases, poorly paid, literally faceless functionaries.  After the document is opened and processed, at the end the data is stored to the database to generate recommendations, which other functionaries of this bureaucracy may use to generate more generic files.

Editor’s note: This is going to get weird and profane, but I hope you can stick with me through it all.

Reader discretion advised. This essay includes a discussion of manifest sexual content, which may be uncomfortable. Further, it includes latent sexual content, which can be far more disturbing.

bitcoin and MMT can both be read in a more radical, 

btc as of itself is a ridiculously inefficient way to do anything

the true dangerous aspect of btc is not money laundering, the true threat of bitcoin lies in its revolutionary potential, create and program alternate economis that are uncoupled, radical diversification, that money can be mutable, that it is not a convenient shortand for coordination of economic activity, something in between a bond, does not require an intermediary



the ideological equivalent of mmt is tesla, yes its a cult stock, but seriously, what is wrong, it seems to me the only stupid ppl are the ppl stupid enough to short the thing
