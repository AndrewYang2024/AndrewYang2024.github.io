> The year is 1897 or 1898. Try to imagine him, briskly stepping off a cross-Channel steamer, a forceful, burly man, in his mid-twenties, with a handlebar mustache. He is confident and well spoken, but his British speech is without the polish of Eton or Oxford. He is well dressed, but the clothes are not from Bond Street. With an ailing mother and a wife and growing family to support, he is not the sort of person likely to get caught up in an idealistic cause. His ideas are thoroughly conventional. He looks—and is—every inch the sober, respectable businessman.

{% newthought ' There has always been a roguish charm'%} native to the craft of short selling, the practice of sticking one’s neck out to bet on the ill fortune of companies or the decline of nations if one is brave or foolish enough. James Fisk Jr.’s scheme to short Confederate bonds right at the end of the Civil War is well worth a movie adaptation, and the hedge funds who shorted the housing market during the 2007 crash got theirs. 

Personally, my favorite short seller is a businessman who never held much capital to his name. Yet that would not stop him tilting at one of the wealthiest windmills of his time—the Congo Free State—and winning. The Congo Free State, which lay within the borders of what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was the private colony of King Leopold II of Belgium, a monarch who had built up an unimpeachable reputation with his African “philantropy.” His name is Edmund Dene Morel, a clerk at Elder Dempster, the Liverpool shipping firm with a contract with King Leopold himself to connect Europe to his African domain.

Every good short selling story starts with a flash of insight—the realization of an imbalance in the numbers that must be corrected. As a clerk, Morel observed the movement of goods in and out of the Congo Free State. Precious shipments of rubber and ivory flowed out of the colony while nothing but arms, ammunition, and soldiers flowed in. This account could not be balanced except by the hidden addition of slave labor on a massive scale.

>  Morel was right. We now know that the value of the rubber, ivory, and other riches coming to Europe each year on the Elder Dempster ships was roughly five times that of goods being shipped to the Congo that were destined for Africans. In return for the rubber and ivory, Morel knew, it was not possible that the Congo's Africans were being paid in money—which he knew they were not allowed to use—or in goods that came from elsewhere, for Elder Dempster had the cargo monopoly. Clearly, they were not being paid at all.

Confronted with the duty to act, he carefully assembles the means of action. Ever the sober businessman, he plies his menagerial skill to gradually build up the largest humanitarian effort of his time, the Congo Reform Association. His effort enlists both the business and the intellectual classes in waging a bitter propaganda war against King Leopold and his proxies. Famous writers including Arthur Conan Doyle, Booker T. Washington, and Mark Twain and the socialist leader Émile Vandervelde sign up for the cause. Diplomats, missionaries, and the photographer Hezekiah Andrew Shanu smuggle images and stories of atrocities from within Congo to be reported by his media machine.

Through Morel’s and his allies’ efforts, the brutality of King Leopold’s private regime was revealed to all. The chopping of hands as punishment for failing to meet rubber quotas. The liberal use of the *chicotte*—”a whip of raw, sun-dried hippopotamus hide, cut into a long sharp-edged corkscrew strip.” The murderous habits of the *Force Publique,* the “security” forces who ran the show. These all entered common knowledge and decisively settled the Congo Question. In 1908, the Belgian government annexes the Congo Free State, ending King Leopold’s control, after which reports of atrocities in the colony drop.

What stands out in Morel’s story is how far he went while mostly working within the confines of the Edwardian era’s media and political environment. He was not a radical in the ideological sense, campaigning against the cruelties of imperialism in order to maintain his vision of a liberal imperialism that still assumed African subjects to be subordinate.  Yet he so skillfully exploited all the levers at his disposal, essentially weaponizing the ability to be extremely annoying, that he created something novel—a modern, bottom-up, trans-Atlantic human rights campaign.

His activist streak would continue into the First World War, which led to a brief imprisonment for his pacifist sympathies, and afterwards, when he criticized the Treaty of Versailles. Unfortunately for him, neither cause had anywhere near to the success of the original campaign. 

{% newthought ' Every good short selling story'%} begins with the mispricing of an asset. Nevertheless, the trader believes that the financial system, which enables that mispricing—a mispricing so egregious as to be highly profitable—also contains within itself the means to correct it. Traders, as a rule, do not bet on the long arc of history. Thus, any short seller who stays in this business does so in the belief that such corrections are repeatable enough and occurs within timeframes short enough to not lose money.

Given that a short position carries unlimited downside and the uncertainty embedded in any human endeavor, why would anyone do this? Sure, one can pore over all the empirical foundations of the efficient markets hypothesis and conduct every possible bit of due diligence to steel one’s stomach to the potential loss, but psychologically, a large short position trade still requires nothing short of a rock-solid—I would even say deranged—belief in market efficiency. Where does such faith come from?

## Creation Myth

{% newthought ' For most people,'%} the history of the François Frères Cooperage (established 1910) would be an unremarkable footnote properly relegated to some industry magazine. But for a narrow class of individuals, this history is the founding myth of their profession—a story that repeats itself across history as a monomyth as old as time.

To them, it evokes the wisdom of ancient Phoenician traders,  pondering probabilities while standing amid lush olive groves planted by their ancestors.

It relives the reflection of a society still reeling from its headlong swing from the Roaring Twenties into the Depression of the Thirties.

We call members of this profession, whether they identify with such labels or not, **value investors**. 

Ever since I dipped my toes into financial markets, I have always found the anthropology of investors far more interesting than than technical aspects of investing itself. When I first saw that RealVision interview, I was deeply moved by the two men’s conversation as they walked alongside a snowy Alpine road. It was so obvious to me that they weren’t *really* talking about barrels. They were speaking to a deeply ingrained, wholesome instinct in each of us that there are things in this world that are worth protecting. These are our **values**. And this gives rise to a somewhat vindictive belief that those who violate our values also deserve and will receive their comeuppance in due time.

The roguish charm of the short-seller is thus the obverse of the faith of the value investor.

Certainly, professional short sellers will rarely couch the motivation of their work in such terms. They would like to imagine that they have checked their sentimentality at the door and before they log on to their Bloomberg terminals—there is no room for faith in a cutthroat industry. But their preferences are revealed by their actions. Short selling is a structurally unprofitable enterprise, and can only be justified financially as a means of hedging the long side of a fully diversified long-short portfolio. 

>  Even for [Jim] Chanos, who is good at this, “the short book — as represented by Ursus — has lost 0.7 percent annually” from founding through the end of 2017. Oops!
>
> The obvious lesson is: Don’t put all your money in a short-selling fund. (Not investing advice.) Stocks mostly go up, so you want to be *long* stocks, not *short* them. But the deeper lesson is that, if you have access to a great short seller, you can use that to get *long more* stocks…
>
> …if you get long 190 percent chosen randomly, and short 90 percent and you’re really good at it—where “really good” means only “losing 0.7 percent a year”—then you can get about double the performance of the S&P without extra volatility, and when markets crash you can actually make money. 
>
> Of course this is an obvious textbook lesson in the benefits of diversification. But it is also a rather inspiring human story. Jim Chanos has developed an unusual skill in a niche activity that, in itself, is not particularly profitable. It happens; there are people who are really good at solving crossword puzzles or playing the French horn or identifying warblers. But the magic of finance allows Chanos to transmute his intrinsically unprofitable skill into a profitable business. It takes as its raw material abstract excellence and turns it into money. The moral is almost: If you find something you love doing, and you work hard to become extraordinarily good at it, you can get rich doing it, *even if it loses money*. As long as it has uncorrelated returns.

Traders will constantly opine on the difference between being right versus making money, but I always find such pronouncements dishonest. If you are making a trade rather than socking all your money away in vanilla index funds, you certainly believe that are right in doing so. A trader may appear to be mercenary in their dispassionate ability to exit failing positions and cut losses. Over time, a trader develops a process for correcting yourself and identifying when your initial trade thesis was incorrect, but they adhere to that empirical process out of an even stronger faith that markets eventually get things right, and they simply happened to be wrong in reading the market’s ultimate intentions.

The value investors I’ve followed love to quote scenes from *The Godfather,* and I totally see the family resemblance. Organized crime appears at first as a trustless enterprise with perpetual rounds of assassination and betrayal. Yet it is within this turmoil that emerges a higher trust, faith in an inviolable code of honor that makes sense to no one except those within the circle (or watch Mafia films).

## Duck and Cover

{% newthought ' The Congo Reform Association continued to preach reform,'%}  in the Belgian Congo for several years after the annexation in 1908. It was disbanded in 1913 as the world had moved on to other things, but the system of forced labor and its hallmarks of the *chicotte*, hostages, starvation, paramilitaries, and arson proved persistent.

> Reports of abuses against gatherers of wild rubber in the Congo did drop off markedly after the Belgian takeover of 1908. In the following years there was far less news of villages burned or of women and children held hostage. There was no more officially sanctioned severing of hands. What lay behind the change, however, was not a kinder and gentler regime brought about by the reformers, but several other developments. One was the gradual shift from wild rubber to cultivated rubber. Another was the introduction of a new method of forcing people to work that drew much less protest from missionaries and humanitarians: taxes.
>
> The Belgian administrators who took over from Leopold saw that they needed plantations of cultivated rubber, because if all the rubber harvested came from wild vines, Africans desperate to meet their quotas would cut them all down; vines were already becoming scarce in parts of the country.

The twin World Wars placed great demand on the Congo’s resources. Hochschild writes, “More than 80 percent of the uranium in the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs came from the heavily guarded Congo mine of Shinkolobwe.” Tin, gold, and copper mining, in additional to the cultivated rubber trade boomed at the cost of human misery.

While the world was certainly a better place for having the injustice of the Congo revealed, and some of its worst excesses curtailed, one must understand the limits of what working within the system means.

Morel succeeded, not just by the moral force of his conviction, but because of the coincidence between that moral conviction and the interests of powers larger than he. The brutality of King Leopold’s rule and the Congo Question threatened the legitimacy of the principle of benevolent colonial rule. This is not to downplay his success, the story of Morel and his allies is still a story that moves me no matter how many times I think about it again, but to maintain a sober vision of what was possible at the time. 

Why does a society allow for activists, despite the headaches they bring?

Why do financial markets allow for short selling, even if they may impose all sorts of restrictions (uptick rule, temporary bans, etc.) on such behavior?

If you make money as a short seller, be grateful and don’t gloat.

You are not being compensated for being right. You are being compensated—*tolerated* by The System—for providing liquidity. That’s it. Nobody cares about anything else. Nobody cares about how much you care about doing the right thing, exposing fraud, or how clever you are.

The things you value, the reasons why you stay in this game, are completely irrelevant to The Game itself. 

The continued success of short selling as a business depends on the fact that there will always be mispricings that need to be fixed—yelled at until they go away. It is not a healthy state of mind to continuously to tilt at windmills while being blamed for literally anything bad that happens in financial markets—hell hath no fury like a bullish investor after a decline—but it does breed an admirable brutal honesty and humility in its practitioners. Veteran short-sellers like Marc Cohodes, known for his colorful language and gleeful belligerence, will freely admit that their obsession with correcting markets are akin to a form of “mental disorder.” 

And then there are these so-called “value investors.”

## Midwit

There is a class of mediocrity who adopt the rhetoric of “value,” opining on the eternal virtue of *real* over “fake” growth, and couch such opinions as pronouncement of fact by donning the trappings of security analysis. They have read somewhere in a textbook that value investing as a factor is a form of mean reversion strategy, but they have not quite internalized that fact. As a strategy, value investing is not right or wrong. It is simply a choice or style of investing among a universe of options (trend-following, momentum, etc.) that generates a unique return profile based on the tendency of valuations to converge on some fair price based on a measure of an asset’s fundamentals.

These midwits are distinguished by an overwhelming sense of entitlement, which only increases as they lose money. The issue is not that that they are wrong or have trouble admitting their own mistakes—everyone does that to some extent—but that they use their losses to justify some unfalsifiable claim about how right they were all along.

There is always some sinister force manipulating markets—the Federal Reserve, etc.—that cheat them out of money. But eventually, *eventually,* their patience will pay off and they will triumph based on some Excel-spreadsheet-caliber model of cash flows. 

In psychoanalytical terms, this is a classic example of *overidentification,* which the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek defines as the practice of “taking the system more seriously than it takes itself seriously,” where the midwit overidentifies with their role in improving market efficiency.

The midwit is thus the financial version of the incel.

Given the absolutely awful nature of their rhetoric and the occasional incident of domestic terrorism, incels (short for the involuntarily celibate) are not a group easily defended. But I’ve always felt a measure of empathy because there is often some real pain behind that self-identification.

Incels, at the very least, are a highly self-aware group. No one really wants to identify as an incel. Like a puddle of oil sitting atop a watery surface, they cohere together into a category not so much out of mutual attraction, but because the attraction of the polar water molecules with each other are so much stronger and cast the oil out of their midst.

As alien as their jargon and ideology might be, the premise of inceldom is quite simple to understand, mainly because they are true.

It is not controversial to say that dating can be a humiliating and dehumanizing experience, especially if you lack confidence or don’t have an ideal set of attributes. There are awful, superficial people out there who take advantage of the fact that other people are attracted to them. As much as we would like to admit otherwise, people do discriminate against each other based on looks and significantly so both inside and outside the context of dating. Everyone *should* be able to find a meaningful, intimate relationship—no one deserves to be alone—and being bad at dating should *not* deny one that aspect of life. Yet in practice, that ends up being the case.

What separates the involuntarily celibate from the merely unhappily single is how one reacts to those facts of life. The incel becomes bitter, seeing the dating market in terms of [Stacy’s, Becky’s, and Chad’s](https://www.vox.com/2018/4/28/17290256/incel-chad-stacy-becky). These are literally caricatured (i.e., memed) archetypes of men and women who play the dating game according to their narcissistic objectives. In such a world, it is honorable to withdraw rather than participate in the corruption.

The unhappily single realize that there isn’t really a conspiracy of Stacy’s, Becky’s, and Chad’s out to get them. There are real people on the other side, some of whom are also struggling with the same pain of trying to present their best foot forward and falling in the process. Sure, the process can be unfair. The deregulation of free markets will necessarily generate a disaffected class of failed suitors, but that is the price of freedom, and it is up to each of us to make the best we can of the situation. Everywhere there are real people with honest intentions who are just trying to find a person to spend their life with.

At the end of it all, what is the incel really holding out for? Beneath all the crass talk about sex and hatred, it’s quite obvious that they genuinely want a meaningful, wholesome relationship, and it is their defense of that idea, which is so in conflict with their direct experience of dating, or their abstracted perception of dating, which transforms from something respectable into a self-absorbed defense of their own ego and self-righteousness.

Similarly, if midwits can learn something from incels, it is to realize that they are all suffering from the same delusion. Don’t delude yourself. Your railing about the Fed and shielding old pensioners from moral hazard isn’t really about defending the proper functioning markets—it’s about protecting your own sense of overidentification, based on absorbing the rhetoric of value but not grasping its core premise. The idea that sending out a lone bearish SPY put spread into the void as a act of rebellion is somehow, in the far future, going to protect some grandma’s 401k is absolutely ludicrous.

It’s okay to feel this way sometimes, but you are supposed to outgrow this stage of development once you start running actual money for a while.

Markets, dating or financial, are real. They are concrete entities that allocate resources among different parties in order to have real impacts on people’s lives. It is dangerous to wade too far into the abstraction of markets and misunderstand their nature as flawed aggregates of human behavior, most of which is just people trying to do their best.

Value investors are made, not born.

And what can be made can be unmade.

And if you know a recovering value investor, or even one in denial, please send this to them so they can get proper help.
