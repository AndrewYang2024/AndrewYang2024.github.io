<p><span class="newthought"> Alex was a master of the coffee nap. </span>  Despite her worn-down state, she could gauge the depth of her exhaustion in precise degrees of caffeine. Three to be exact. A triple-shot of espresso would be enough to nudge her awake after ten beautiful minutes of sleep.</p>

<p>Her home office was furnished with a pristine espresso machine, which stood proudly as the bastion of her productivity. Although her skill with the Swiss-made instrument was by no means impressive, the shots she pulled still surpassed what passed for ‚Äújoe‚Äù in her adopted country. Bad coffee was just one of many indignities that America inflicted on her Continentally-raised palate‚Äîa disgusting substance whose only redeeming quality was its convenience.</p>

<p>But the espresso machine was out of commission that night, waiting on some parts she had ordered the week before. So she walked over to the refrigerator in the kitchenette and cracked open a bottle of cold brew. It was as if lowering the temperature had induced a phase transition, transmuting what was once non-ingestable into something more tolerable. The cold numbed her tongue to the taste as she forced down the American liquid. Having flooded her gullet with sufficient stimulus and a few helpings of tea biscuits, she stumbled onto her bed. The cool spring night was bleeding into dawn, and the birds perched outside of her bedroom window were already heralding the new morning. Without a care for them or for the world, she lay flat on her belly and slept.</p>

<p><span class="newthought"> Alex dreamt that she was flying under a moonless sky. </span>  Flying felt much like swimming, she thought, without the exercise. Her arms dangled loosely in the shape of a <em>v</em>, passively generating lift. She was searching for her companions, a flock of albatrosses that had merged with her not long ago, but they proved difficult to spot in the rolling fog. The birds had simply melted away into the murkiness of the sea mist.</p>

<p>Though nowhere seen, their wingbeats reverberated through the moist night air in an audible trail. She cocked her head to triangulate the source of the sound, which seemed to arrive uniformly from every direction. It was then that she realized that the sound came directly from above her. It was a balmy night, she noted. Her feathery friends were probably circling upwards into the sky, riding the rising thermals over the sea. She kicked her feet out for an extra burst of speed and took off in a corkscrew. Their wingbeats grew louder as she climbed higher. Her hair whipped wildly around, its strands dancing from her scalp, as she rounded each coil of the spiral.</p>

<p>The air erupted into a chorus of birdsong when she finally shot out from the sea fog, a raucous welcome of her late arrival. Inundated, Alex fell into a daze‚Äîthe moonless sky a starry tapestry above her head, the mist a damp carpet below her feet.</p>

<p>Yet in this arrangement was a small detail, one which bothered Alex and interrupted her suspension within the moment. The albatrosses, with beaks opening and closing in rhythm, warbled in the familiar chirping of tree-bound sparrows rather than the shrieking calls of roving seabirds. As the pinpricks of starlight widened into the glimmers of sunbeams, she realized that they were not chirping hello, but rather goodbye. Perched on the threshold of wakefulness, she hesitated. She wanted to stay a little longer, having enjoyed her dream-world so far.</p>

<p>It was then that she stalled.</p>

<p>Suddenly, she no longer felt the wind against her face. Waving wildly, she tried to latch onto the invisible currents that had carried her up, but their slippery strands simply parted at her fingertips. The chirping of the birds grew to a fever pitch as they gawked in horror. Alex plummeted straight into the depths of the fog, screaming as she contemplated the horror of slamming into the ocean at terminal velocity.</p>

<p>There was no pain and no splash. No sense of where atmosphere ended and water began. At the end of the descent, she found herself floating atop a shadowy, endless pool of water before an immaculate sunrise. Alex scratched her nose and looked around. The fog and the birds were all gone.</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>Wo ist alles hin?</em>‚Äù she whispered.</p>

<p>The ocean murmured back in reply.</p>

<p><em>Brrrrrrrrr</em></p>

<p>Murmurs of eddies toppling over each other across a mirror of water.</p>

<p><em>Brrrrrrrrr</em></p>

<p><label for="mf-id-1" class="margin-toggle">‚äï</label><input type="checkbox" id="mf-id-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/img/a001.png" /><br /></span></p>

<p><span class="newthought"> The whirring of the printer woke Alex. </span>  Without reaching for her phone, she reckoned that she had managed to oversleep on a workday, but that was not her immediate concern. Looking over the edge of her pillow, she could read the thin, squinty letters on printer‚Äôs small LED screen, which announced that a fax transmission from an unknown sender was underway. No one at the office had ever faxed her anything before. Nor did she ever recall setting up her desktop inkjet as as a fax machine either. Yet it was ejecting what appeared to be, from the accumulating heap of paper on the ground, the scanned pages of a typewritten monograph.</p>

<p>When the LED screen blinked off at last, she stepped into her into her slippers to gather and collate the mess.</p>

<p>The monograph bore the nondescript title, <em>A Review of Anticipatory Systems,</em> with no author indicated. Alex had seen the term before in graduate school, when she was completing her doctorate at Stanford‚Äôs Department of Economics. That was where Williams, her current boss, had also went. Anticipatory systems theory was one of several intellectual rabbit-holes she indulged in aside from the academic curriculum. Memories, both fond and otherwise, returned as she thumbed through the pages to check their order.</p>

<p>Pages seventeen and eighteen were missing.</p>

<p>Alex circled the room and then checked underneath the bed. There she found the missing pages, along with a note.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alex,</p>

  <p>Please come to the Board office (Eccles 2F) today:</p>

  <p>3:00 PM March 22.</p>

  <p>Tell no one else about this.</p>

  <p>‚ÄîJay</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She wondered if the message had actually been intended for her. It could be an elaborate if oddly specific prank, she reasoned. Her profession attracted the ire of online cranks who wished them (mostly metaphorical) harm. But if Jay was actually <em>that</em> Jay, it was a direct order from her boss‚Äô boss‚Äîthe chairman himself‚Äîthat she could not ignore.</p>

<p>It was almost noon. She checked her notifications. Twenty-seven minutes ago, a colleague had asked her where she was, and if she could help him with some data analysis after lunch. Biting her lip, she tapped out a terse reply.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I apologize for the short notice. But due to a personal emergency, I will not be in the office today.</p>

  <p>I will still be in contact through email. Feel free to call my cell if you need me urgently.</p>

  <p>Regards,</p>

  <p>Alex</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She sent out the message and shoved the <em>Review</em> into her backpack. If she were to honor this mysterious invitation, she would have to leave now. It was presumptuous of this Jay to ask her to simply drop everything and hop onto the next train from New York to DC, but she would oblige. What really bothered her was the mystery of the request, which tortured Alex with her own native sense of curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="newthought"> Williams glanced downwards at the small table in front of him.</span>  Both his MacBook and a half-eaten Caf√© Acela sandwich competed for his attention. He sighed, shutting the laptop‚Äôs lid so he could polish off his meager meal in quiet communion with the other solitary Amtrak riders. It was not like he could prepare materials for a surprise meeting he knew nothing about anyway.</p>

<p>All he had to go on was the anonymous document tucked under his arm. The chairman had referenced it this during their conversation earlier.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDid you read it?‚Äù the chairman had asked. ‚ÄúThe <em>Review</em>?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou mean the one you handed to me on Tuesday? Yea, I did. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ strange.‚Äù</p>

<p>Although some of the mathematical notations were unfamiliar and, in some respects, archaic, every sentence of it was sharply written, even if not immediately comprehensible. Having read it over multiple times, he still could not follow every single one of its threads‚Äîit almost reminded him of Alex. He had been equally mesmerized by her mental prowess back in his Stanford days, a secret intellectual crush on his part.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood. good.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy do you ask?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúCome to the usual meeting room as soon as possible and you‚Äôll find out soon enough. I‚Äôll be waiting.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm not in town anymore. I‚Äôm back in my regular office now.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, my apologies. I thought you were planning to stay for a bit to sort out the rest?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI really did want to, but I had to return. Say, could we do a conference call instead?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo. I need to speak to you in person. Just you and me.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThree then. I can make it to you at three.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll see you then.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnything else?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat is all. Goodbye.‚Äù</p>

<p>It was already an inauspicious morning. The ten year had just dipped below the three month tenor, and the chairman‚Äôs unexpected phone call lent the yield curve inversion an almost sinister edge. Were the two things somehow connected? He rejected the idea. That was something for the traders to fret about. Surely there were more important matters to summon him over. Matters that, for some reason, could not be resolved remotely in a conference call.</p>

<p>He had left DC just two days ago, having sat through marathon discussions from Tuesday to Wednesday between the chairman, the governors, and the other regional presidents. Together, the committee had arrived at the anti-climactic decision to leave the bedrock benchmark rate untouched, along with a promise to revisit the matter in three months time. His eyelids grew heavy as he reviewed the last decade of monetary decisions in his head. It grew difficult to resist the soft lull of the drifting train.</p>

<p>Williams woke up just in time to see the train pull into Washington Union station. Dusting off the crumbs on his shirt, he made his way to the portico outside of the entrance of the Main Hall to hail a taxi. Everything was running perfectly on schedule. In no time, he was cruising down the length of Constitution Avenue and riding past the monuments and memorials of the National Mall.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm back,‚Äù Williams whispered to himself.</p>

<p>The taxi dropped him off at the entrance of the Marriner S. Eccles building‚Äîa towering, rectilinear behemoth of Georgia marble. Neither quite elegant nor quite ugly, it cut a striking figure against the clear spring sky. In a city teeming with ornate symbols of power, it was maybe only natural that the real thing would be found in an otherwise unadorned structure. To its critics, the building exuded a neoclassical boredom as unimaginative as the four floors of functionaries who staffed it.</p>

<p>The chairman was already waiting by the time he reached the conference room. The ambience reminded him of a very austere kindergarten, where each committee member customarily sat behind his or her emblazoned nameplate on the vast wooden table. At the center, of course, was Chairman Powell, flanked by Governors Clarida, Quarles, Bowman, and Brainard, or as they knew each other‚ÄîJay, Richard, Randy, Miki, and Lael. Even as their names shone brightly on the table, the other governors were absent today‚Äîas were all of the usual observers and hangers-on inserted in the name of transparency.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHello John,‚Äù Powell greeted him half-heartedly, turning grim. ‚ÄúThank you for coming all the way here from New York.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo problem at all,‚Äù Williams replied as he closed the door behind him, sealing off the room. ‚ÄúNice to see you again.‚Äù</p>

<p>Williams mustered a smile and took his seat across from the chairman at the yawning oaken table.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you have many questions for me,‚Äù Powell began. Even alone, he spoke with the same gravitas he applied to his media appearances‚Äîa patient voice for communicating the committee‚Äôs esoteric decisions to an implacable outside world.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Williams nodded. ‚ÄúI do.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd to understand that, you must first understand why <em>we</em> are here,‚Äù Powell continued. ‚ÄúYou work with Alexandra Ender, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes. Officially, she‚Äôs still an intern, but she‚Äôs basically my right-hand woman when it comes to policy. Wicked sharp.‚Äù Williams stopped himself before gushing further.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSo you trust her?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAbsolutely, we‚Äôve known each other for years.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good to know. I may need someone like her in the future.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôd hate to have her go,‚Äù Williams laughed. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôd be happy to leave you her number and email.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo need,‚Äù Powell brushed him off. ‚ÄúI prefer more discreet means of contact.‚Äù</p>

<p>Before Williams could press further, Powell‚Äôs phone buzzed on the table.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes?‚Äù Powell answered as he picked it up. ‚ÄúOkay, send her up to me.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="newthought"> Alex ascended the spiral staircase towards the third floor,</span>  unsure what lay at the top. The stairs brought her to a well-lit corridor leading to a set of broad, paneled doors waiting for her. She knocked hesitantly.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù</p>

<p>As she nudged the door ajar, she caught Powell‚Äôs eyes peering into her own.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNow, all of us are together,‚Äù Powell said approvingly. ‚ÄúAnd we can begin.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAlex?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWait, John? You‚Äôre here too?‚Äù Alex looked at Williams. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this all about?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI have just as much of a clue as you do.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThere, there,‚Äù Powell smiled. ‚ÄúSettle down.‚Äù</p>

<p>Alex took up a chair beside Williams and opened her copy of the <em>Review</em> on the table.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNow if you may,‚Äù the greying chairman folded his hands. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to know what you think of it, <em>Alex</em>.‚Äù</p>

<p>Alex swallowed back a lump. ‚ÄúI was in a bit of rush, so I could only give it a cursory read.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhen you were reading it for the first time,‚Äù Powell‚Äôs eyes were twinkling back at her. ‚ÄúDid something feel odd to you?‚Äù</p>

<p>Alex cleared her throat. ‚ÄúIt felt intentionally‚Ä¶ <em>incomplete?</em> I‚Äôm also not sure why this was given to me‚Äî‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAren‚Äôt financial systems an example of an anticipatory system?‚Äù Powell interrupted.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, yes.‚Äù Alex read from the opening paragraph. ‚Äú<em>An anticipatory system must have three parts: itself, a predictive model of its own future, and a mechanism to act upon itself based on that model. Examples can be found in biology, finance, psychology, and any other field concerning collective behavior.</em>‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut your intuition is correct,‚Äù Powell said. ‚ÄúThe text conceals its true intentions. The document you hold in your hands is a translation of the original German manuscript, which was smuggled from Vienna, across the Atlantic, into the hands of the New York Fed. In order to evade Axis censors, it was vital that it appeared as no more than an innocuous mathematical text.‚Äù</p>

<p>Not uncommon for genius to be entwined with revolution, Alex thought, and the <em>Review</em> certainly suggested both.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSuppose there exists a network of individual anticipatory systems that interact with each other,‚Äù Powell began. ‚ÄúAs with any interconnected network, the behavior of each individual depends on the behavior of the others, but for anticipatory networks, the observed behavior may matter less than what that behavior reveals about the internal predictive model of another participant. To illustrate this point, a poker tournament can be won while keeping one‚Äôs hand face down. One only needs to read the faces of other players and infer their knowledge of the game from their reactions.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTaking this further, an anticipatory network may sometimes be better understood as a network of <em>models</em> rather than as a network of <em>individuals</em>. To continue the analogy, if people gamble on the outcome of the tournament without seeing either the player‚Äôs faces or hands, they perceive the event not as a game between poker players but between different poker-playing strategies‚Äîinferred from each player‚Äôs match history‚Äîacting through human hands.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFrom the gamblers‚Äô perspective, the strategies of each player are in every sense as ‚Äòreal‚Äô as the players themselves. After all, the models are the ‚Äúthing‚Äù they are betting on: the human a mere vehicle. From the perspective of the anticipatory systems analyst, the internal predictive models are as real as the underlying systems‚Äîa network of individuals can be conceptualized as a network of models. As duals, they are fundamentally equivalent views that can be naturally exchanged for each other.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut duals are not identical. Although systems are constrained to behave in a strictly causal way, with one interaction leading to another, models are not. The framework of causality cannot be applied to the ‚Äòmeta-behavior‚Äô of models interacting with other models, because these interactions exist out of time. To the question, ‚Äúwhen did rock beat scissors,‚Äù one can only answer, ‚Äòwhenever the rules of <em>rock, paper, scissors</em> were first conceivable‚Äô‚Äînow, then, and forever.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis acausality has other consequences. Even when the myriad interactions between individuals in a crowd can be exhaustively catalogued, it is often impossible to predict their collective behavior once the number of individuals becomes overwhelming. As when dealing with the sudden appearance of an epidemic, it becomes impossible to trace the chains of causality. On the other hand, it is very simple to design games‚Äîeven games with very rich behavior‚Äîthat always converge on completely predictable outcomes no matter how many players it has and how clever its players are. An example is a class of games that guarantee a single winner but that do not explicitly specify a winner-take-all dynamic.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou and I know these games very well. ‚Äù Powell said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt we?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄùIt‚Äôs not like you to beat around the bush.‚Äù Williams tapped his foot. ‚ÄúSo why was it sent to us? And why did we keep it?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI find that terrible things tend to happen when I speak plainly,‚Äù Powell retorted. ‚ÄúBut if you can indulge me for a little longer.‚Äù</p>

<p>Alex looked anxiously between her two superiors. She had been quietly taking notes on the chairman‚Äôs words the whole time.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI grant that everything I‚Äôve said up to now sounds far removed from everyday life,‚Äú Powell said. ‚ÄúAnd it would be, if not for the appendix on approximation theory.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAn anticipatory network as I have described, is still only an approximation of anticipatory networks in the real world, and the model-system duality is simply a convenient mathematical abstraction. But if certain conditions hold, this approximation becomes quite good and the duality has real implications.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFor example, if we are able to gather enough people, make them tightly interconnected, and train them such that they respond as much to abstractions as they do to realities, then something interesting emerges.  When they can no longer distinguish between symbolic manipulations and physical facts, the distinction between causal behavior and acausal meta-behavior is erased.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIn such a world the difference between prediction and action‚Äîbetween prophesy and future‚Äîis a meaningless one.‚Äù</p>

<p>Alex‚Äôs blood stirred. Everything was coming together now.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis was the dream of Astrid Ender, who wrote the <em>Review</em> and arranged for its delivery,‚Äù Powell explained. ‚ÄúYour great-grandmother, Alex.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWow,‚Äù Williams gasped, looking at her with newfound admiration.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Enders are a long intellectual lineage dating back to the Austro-Hungarians,‚Äù Powell explained. ‚ÄúBefore their collapse, they were quite well-known in monetary circles. It was only a matter of time before Astrid‚Äôs descendants would make her way back to us.‚Äù</p>

<p>As grateful as she was to learn the history of her family, Powell‚Äôs scrutiny made Alex slightly uneasy. Much to her relief, he quickly returned to the main discussion.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDo you understand now,‚Äù Powell shook as he set his eyeglasses on the table. ‚ÄúWhat it means to control the yield curve?‚Äù</p>

<p>Williams looked at Powell blankly and felt left behind. He could not comprehend how yield curve control, a newfangled policy from the Bank of Japan, fit into the picture.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you get it, John? The yield curve does not predict central bank intervention,‚Äù Alex said. ‚ÄúThe change in the yield curve <em>IS</em> central bank intervention.‚Äù</p>

<p>Powell laughed heartily as he saw the flash of realization over Williams‚Äô face. He had been waiting patiently for this moment.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe yield curve whispers to us from the future,‚Äù Powell said. ‚ÄúBecause we have set up a massive anticipatory network that satisfies the conditions set forth in the <em>Review</em>. A network that pulls forward the eternal future into the present and allows us to send messages to our past selves.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNow you know the true history of the modern Fed and why we control the most liquid predictive market in the world, connecting  a global network of traders and investors who transact daily with each other. The new Fed was born in the flames of the Second World War. The moment Marriner Eccles received the translation of her manuscript in 1941.‚Äù</p>

<p>This was all so ridiculous to Williams, but less so to Alex. She had nursed her own private doubts of late about the dual mandate and the retconned creation mythology of the Federal Reserve it embodied, opinionss she dared not air in public.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Federal Reserve acts as the eyes of the Republic, providing advance warning of threats to our democracy,‚Äù Powell said proudly. ‚ÄúOur stewardship of capital markets is of only secondary concern.‚Äù</p>

<p>Williams sank mutely into his chair.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe the treasury market transmission network is still an imperfect one, the financial equivalent of smoke signals,‚Äù Powell explained. ‚ÄúWe communicate by inverting the yield curve, and encode information in the timing and the choice of tenors that get inverted. Anything more complicated than that becomes garbled when you try to send messages years back in time.‚Äù</p>

<figure><figcaption></figcaption><img src="/assets/img/Inversion.png" /></figure>

<p>‚ÄúLast August, the entire curve inverted. According to our protocol, the spreads between the three and five year and the two and five year signal mass unrest within two years, with updates to follow. We proceeded by calibrating our monetary antennae by adjusting the federal feds rate upward until we received a follow-up signal. Which we received just this morning, when the three month and ten year flipped. America is going to be hit with a global pandemic.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve tried to warn the executive branch about it. However, unlike in the past, the executive branch is not responding as decisively to the intelligence as we had hoped. The situation is bleak. This is the first time we have operated alone. And there‚Äôs only so much the eyes of the Republic can do.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúDoes no one else know?‚Äù Williams asked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe true purpose of the Federal Reserve is only revealed to the President, a few of his or her trusted advisors, and me,‚Äù Powell said. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm breaching protocol by telling you.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut I believe that there‚Äôs a special destiny that comes with leading the New York Fed.‚Äù Powell rubbed his sleepless eyes. ‚ÄúAnd with the Ender line.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù Williams said. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not sure how I can help.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúMe neither,‚Äù Alex added.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTo be frank with you, I‚Äôm not exactly sure what to do either. But I‚Äôve always known you to have a good head on your shoulders and you said you can vouch for her ability. We‚Äôll think of something together.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù His boss was overbearing sometimes, Williams thought.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre going to have to meet in person, all three of us, more often than our quarterly FOMC committee meetings.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Williams agreed with a sense of dread. Even with the weight of the country on his shoulders, he did not look forward to long commutes to the capital. ‚ÄúWhatever it takes.‚Äù</p>

<p>The two men stared at each other from across the table for a while before Alex interrupted. ‚ÄúSo now what?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs already six,‚Äù Powell said, glancing at the clock. ‚ÄúAre you free to join me for an early supper? Some of Lagarde‚Äôs proteges will be attending and it would be good to make introductions. The Europeans are also receiving dire warnings at their ends, it seems.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think I‚Äôll pass, I‚Äôve met all of them anyway,‚Äù Williams said. ‚ÄúI also need some time to process all of this.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHave a good one, John,‚Äù Powell waved.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYea, you too.‚Äù</p>

<p>The chairman waited until Williams was out of earshot.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI guess the Ender is staying?‚Äù</p>

<p>The Ender nodded.</p>

<p>Powell tilted back in his chair and propped his feet on the table. ‚ÄúBetween you me, I was never quite sure John would be up to the task.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI know what what you mean,‚Äù Alex said, stifling a chuckle. ‚ÄúBut I think he‚Äôll be helpful. At least I hope so.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAmen,‚Äù Powell quipped.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs all a waste of time then? All that discussion about the economy and rate hikes and rate cuts. It‚Äôs really all just a front for fiddling with the dials on a massive time machine, right?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúCorrect.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHa, no wonder it never made any sense. I figured you were smarter than that.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>Some</em> of us,‚Äù Powell corrected. ‚ÄúNot all of us are in the know like we are.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúMy, what else are you hiding?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Äù Powell hesitated thoughtfully. ‚ÄúWe do also have a plunge protection team.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs no secret, it‚Äôs called the Working Group on Financial Markets, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, not that one. There‚Äôs a group of Fed traders who manipulate equity futures around two to three in the morning. We use that window to establish a short-distance communication system that sends messages months rather than years into the past.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt have that on my bingo card.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Eccles building is very large for a reason. It houses things that you cannot even imagine,‚Äù Powell winked. ‚ÄúAnd in due time, you will inherit all of its secrets.‚Äù</p>

<p>In a way, Alex thought, the Eccles‚Äô secrets were her birthright, handed across three generations. And it was not without irony, that the modern Federal Reserve was perpetual indebted to, of all people, a long-dead Austrian economist.</p>

Even though she was just a recent intern, he had asked her to go with him to the committee meeting at the capital.


She had caught him uncharacteristically slacking off yesterday from the corner of her eye, framed in the darkened reflection of her phone. Just quietly standing in the side. Not working. She pretended not to notice. The man rarely took interest in anything other than work and was consumed by the responsibilities and duties of heading the New York office. But Williams could be odd sometimes. Perhaps he was just staring into space.

And suddenly, Williams, her stiff boss, asked her out for lunch today. He had done so in his characteristically awkward fashion.
She was worried. Not for herself, but for him.
Something was not right with her boss.
As she pondered his invitation,
She wondered if his expression, which she had interpreted as shyness, was instead a look of silent horror.


As she walked back to her workstation, she tried to piece together the events of the last week.
Williams had become absent-minded ever since he returned from his trip to the capital two days ago.
He clammed up when she asked him how the committee meeting went. 

Drained.
‚ÄúHow was the powwow with the Powell?‚Äù she asked him on Thursday morning. 
How was the, she ribbed him about it. The kind of humor that made him chortle. But A face of indescribable horror.

At first it was just creepy

Williams did not understand.



Long ago,  But now he was the regional president of the New York Fed, while she was just another rank-and-file economist in the lower echelons of the Division of Financial Stability.

And the most curious puzzle of all

The greying chairman pulled out a sheaf of papers and slid them across the table.  Powell‚Äôs watchful expression delivered him for a moment back to the ordeals of graduate school, sweating in front of his dissertation committee.



I‚Äôm so sorry,

grasping at straws, I need someone to trust

‚ÄúIs this about the papers you sent me?‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry?‚Äù

‚ÄúNever mind,‚Äù she stirred her tea.



Alex took off her headphones and rested them on her neck.

‚ÄúWhat for?‚Äù

as if it were the most normal

‚ÄúOh, for real?‚Äù



‚ÄúDo you need something?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope.‚Äù Williams stood meekly in the doorway. ‚ÄúJust passing by.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you look like you want to talk.‚Äù

‚ÄúAww, back to work then.‚Äù Williams slung a laptop bag over his shoulder and marched back towards the entrance, weaving through the crates of papers piled high on the office floor.

Williams had always been impressed with her intellect and contrarian streak. Despite that, he kept abreast of her work. He was always quick to email her comments on her latest working papers and occasionally dropped by unexpectedly.

She was just about to return to revising her latest draft when her hand bumped against something, knocking it over. It was Williams‚Äô coffee‚Äîhe had run off in a hurry and left it behind.

‚Äú*Shit*,‚Äù she hissed as she yanked her keyboard away to protect it from the fallout.



But the paper cup simply rolled off the table onto the carpet. Setting down the keyboard, she bent over to pick it up. As she pried its lid open, she saw that the cup was entirely empty with no trace of ever having contained liquid inside.
