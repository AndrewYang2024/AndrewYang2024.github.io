<blockquote>
  <p>The assignment of a value to a number is an innocuous act, but the assignment of a meaning to a number is never a morally neutral one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above is my restatement of a recurring theme in <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">Epsilon Theory,</a> which is best described as a finance blog attached to an affinity group. I discovered their writing at a critical moment in my life, and I found their words to be meaningful and hopeful in a time that lacked both. I still pepper my thought with phrases and stories borrowed from the ET canon: <a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/magical-thinking/">Magical Thinking</a> and <a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/the-icarus-moment/">The Icarus Moment</a> are some of my favorite classic ET articles, among others.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fragments of a vessel which are to be glued together must match one another in the smallest details, although they need not be like one another. In the same way a translation, instead of resembling the meaning of the original, must lovingly and in detail incorporate the original‚Äôs mode of signification, thus making both the original and the translation recognizable as fragments of a greater language, just as fragments are part of a vessel.</p>

  <p><strong>Walter Benjamin, Illuminations: Essays and Reflections</strong></p>

<p>I think of ET as my first fragment. Since then, I have continued to collect more fragments from different sources: ≈Ωi≈æek, Graeber, so on and so forth. They are shards that, in their variety and richness, both depreciate and appreciate the value of my initial discovery. Although in many ways I have moved on, ET remains one of my intellectual roots and serves as the oblique namesake of this personal repository of fiction, essays, and art, which may be read as just another fragment‚Äîa loving subversion of the original Epsilon Theory.</p>

> The concept of Narrative is a thoroughly post-modern idea. What I mean by this is that Narrative is a social construction, a malleable public representation of malleable public statements that lacks any inherent Truth with a capital T. In fact, the public statements that go into the construction of a Narrative are often intentionally untrue.

> No, I want to use a proper conception of Narrative, which has no inherent notion of truthfulness and is simply a public representation of a set of public statements made by influential people about the world, because I think that this can help me predict market behaviors that are not easily predictable by factor-based or econometric analysis. To that end, my goal with Epsilon Theory is to identify Narratives, measure their strength, and assess their likely impact on security prices through an application of game theory and information theory.
