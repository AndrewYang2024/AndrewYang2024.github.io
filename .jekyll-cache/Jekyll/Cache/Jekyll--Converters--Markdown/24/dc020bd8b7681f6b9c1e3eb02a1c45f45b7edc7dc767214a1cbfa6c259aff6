  <p>The secret of effective market game-playing, whether you were an investor 100 years ago or you are an investor today, is to recognize that the market game hinges on the <strong>Narrative</strong>, on the strength of the public statements that create <strong>Common Knowledge</strong>. These are the core concepts of Epsilon Theory.</p>

  <p>The concept of Narrative is a thoroughly post-modern idea. What I mean by this is that Narrative is a social construction, a malleable public representation of malleable public statements that lacks any inherent Truth with a capital T. In fact, the public statements that go into the construction of a Narrative are often intentionally untrue.</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>No, I want to use a proper conception of Narrative, which has no inherent notion of truthfulness and is simply a public representation of a set of public statements made by influential people about the world, because I think that this can help me predict market behaviors that are not easily predictable by factor-based or econometric analysis. To that end, my goal with Epsilon Theory is to identify Narratives, measure their strength, and assess their likely impact on security prices through an application of game theory and information theory.</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>It’s the new Narratives, though, that I am most interested in. How do they emerge? How do they sustain themselves? How do they manifest themselves in predictable patterns of behavior?</p>
