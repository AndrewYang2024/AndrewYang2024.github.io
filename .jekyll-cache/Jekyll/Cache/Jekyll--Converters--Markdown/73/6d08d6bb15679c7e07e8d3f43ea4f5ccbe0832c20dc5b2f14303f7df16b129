<p>The above is my subversive reading of a central theme of <a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com">Epsilon Theory,</a> best described as a finance blog attached to an affinity group. I discovered the blog at a critical moment in my life, and found their writing meaningful and hopeful in a time that lacked both. I still pepper my thought with phrases and stories borrowed from the ET canon: <a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/magical-thinking/">Magical Thinking</a> and <a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/the-icarus-moment/">The Icarus Moment</a> are some of my favorite classic ET articles. I can genuinely say that reading them changed me, and for the better.</p>

  <p>Fragments of a vessel which are to be glued together must match one another in the smallest details, although they need not be like one another. In the same way a translation, instead of resembling the meaning of the original, must lovingly and in detail incorporate the originalâ€™s mode of signification, thus making both the original and the translation recognizable as fragments of a greater language, just as fragments are part of a vessel.</p>

<p>In financial writing, I found a fragment of something great and powerful. Since then I have continued to collect fragments from different sources, which in their variety and richness both depreciate and appreciate the value of my first find. Although I have moved on, ET remains one of my intellectual roots and serves as the oblique namesake of this personal repository of fiction, essays, and art. In a sense, this project of mine may be read as just another fragmentâ€”a loving subversion of the original Epsilon Theory.</p>

What I mean by this is that Narrative is a social construction, a malleable public representation of malleable public statements that lacks any inherent Truth with a capital T. In fact, the public statements that go into the construction of a Narrative are often intentionally untrue.

To that end, my goal with Epsilon Theory is to identify Narratives, measure their strength, and assess their likely impact on security prices through an application of game theory and information theory.
