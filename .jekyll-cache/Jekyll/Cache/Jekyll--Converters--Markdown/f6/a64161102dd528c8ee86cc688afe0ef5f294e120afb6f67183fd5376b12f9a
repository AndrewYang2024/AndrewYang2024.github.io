<p><span class="newthought"> Alex was a master of the coffee nap. </span>  Even in her worn-down state, she could gauge the depth of her exhaustion in degrees of caffeine. Three to be exact. A triple-shot of espresso would be enough to nudge her awake gently after ten beautiful minutes of sleep.</p>

<p>Her home office was furnished with a pristine espresso machine, which stood proudly as a bastion of productivity. Although her skill with the Swiss-made instrument was by no means impressive, the shots she pulled still surpassed what passed for â€œjoeâ€ in her adopted country. Bad coffee was just one of many indignities that America inflicted on her Continentally-raised palateâ€”a disgusting substance whose only redeeming quality was its convenience.</p>

<p>But the espresso machine was out of commission that night, waiting on repairs she had put off from the week before. So she walked over to the kitchenette and cracked open a bottle of cold brew from the refrigerator.  The cold numbed her tongue to the taste as she forced it down. It was as if lowering the temperature induced a phase transition, turning what was once non-ingestable into something tolerable. Having flooded her gullet with sufficient stimulus and a few helpings of tea biscuits, she stumbled onto her bed. The cool spring night was bleeding into dawn, and the birds perched outside the bedroom window were already heralding the new morning. Without a care in the world, she lay flat on her belly and slept.</p>

<p><span class="newthought"> Alex dreamt that she was flying. </span>  Flying felt much like swimming, she thought, sans the exercise. Her arms dangled loosely at their sides, passively generating lift. She had companyâ€”a flock of albatrosses who escorted her through the soupy, gray fog and partied the murkiness with their wingbeats.</p>

<p>The birds departed one by one as the dream wore on, until a flock of dozens had finally dwindled into a handful of stragglers. She glided closer to this remaining group, into the vacant center of their formation. Up close, she was inundated by their chatter with each other, which sounded more like the lively chirps of nest-bound sparrows rather than the shrieking calls of roving seabirds.</p>

<p>Their chatter grew more exultant as they spiraled upwards into the sky, riding the thermals over the sea.</p>

<p>The fog began to recede, as did the outlines of her feathery friends, as they climbed higher. They were guiding her back outside, she realized. But she was having so much fun nowâ€”she wanted to stay in her dream-world. Perched on the threshold of wakefulness, she hesitated.</p>

<p>It was then that she stalled. She no longer felt the wind against her face. She waved her hands wildly, trying to latch onto the invisible currents of air that had buoyed her up here, but their slippery strands simply parted at her fingertips. The chirping of the birds crescendoed to a fever pitch as they gawked in horror. Alex plummeted straight into the depths of the fog, screaming as she contemplated the horror of slamming into the ocean at terminal velocity.</p>

<p>And then she blinked.</p>

<p>She found herself levitated over a shadowy, endless pool of water. Alex scratched her nose and looked around. The fog and the birds were all gone.</p>

<p>â€œ<em>Wo ist alles hin?</em>â€ she whispered.</p>

<p>The ocean murmured back in reply.</p>

<p><em>Brrrrrrrrr</em></p>

<p>The murmurs of eddies toppling over each other across a mirror of water.</p>

<p><em>Brrrrrrrrr</em></p>

<p><label for="mf-id-1" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="mf-id-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/img/a001.png" /><br /></span></p>

<p><span class="newthought"> The printer woke her up with its whirring. </span>  Each whir was followed by the flapping sound of a letter-sized sheet being spat out and gliding towards the floor.</p>

<p>Without looking at her phone, Alex reckoned that she had overslept, but her more immediate concern was the accumulating heap of paper strewn about.  She did not recall ever setting up her printer as a fax machine, but somehow it was receiving what appeared to be scanned pages of a typewritten monograph. She slid out the output tray to catch the remainder of the still printing document and bent over the floor to gather the rest.</p>

<p>In total the monograph was forty-one black and white pages. It bore a nondescript title, <em>A Review of Anticipatory Systems,</em> with no author indicated. Alex had heard the term before in graduate school, when she was a PhD student at Stanfordâ€™s Department of Economics. That was where Williams, the regional president of the New York branch and her current boss, had also went for his doctorate. Anticipatory systems theory wasnâ€™t part of the academic curricula, but rather an intellectual rabbit-hole of sorts that she indulged in at the time. Those memories returned to her as she thumbed through the pages, trying to pin down the documentâ€™s various threads as she unraveled its puzzle.</p>

<p><em>I really should head out</em>, Alex thought as the hours ticked by, but the <em>Review</em> was too engrossing. Although some of the mathematical notations were unfamiliar and, in some respects, archaic, every sentence of it was sharply written, even if not immediately comprehensible. She could not follow every single one of its threads, but such was the price of experiencing its brilliance for the first time.</p>

<p>And on the last page was a messageâ€”not type-written this timeâ€” in bold letters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BOARDâ€™S OFFICES AT ECCLES 2F</p>

  <p>3:00 PM TODAY MARCH 22</p>

  <p>â€”Jay</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She wondered if the message was truly intended for her. After all, she had never spoken with the chairman, let alone on first name terms. It could all be an elaborate, if oddly specific, prank for all she knew.</p>

<p>It was almost noon now, and she reached for her phone to check her notifications.</p>

<p><em>I apologize for the short notice</em>, she began typing out a reply. <em>But due to a personal emergency, I will not be in the office today.</em></p>

<p><em>I will still be in contact through email. Feel free to call my cell if you need me.</em></p>

<p><em>Regards,</em></p>

<p><em>Alexandra</em></p>

<p>She sent out the message and rushed to pack her bag. If she were to honor this meeting invitation, she would have to leave now as well.  It was a little crazy to simply drop everything and hop onto the next train to DC, but somehow that was in her blood. Moreover, the complete mystery of the request tortured Alex with her native sense of curiosity.</p>

<p>It was already an inauspicious day with the ten year dipping below the three month tenor that morning. The mysterious phone call lent the yield curve inversion an almost sinister edge. Were the two things somehow connected? He rejected the idea. That was something for the traders to fret about. Surely the Board of Governors had more important matters to summon him for. Matters that, for some reason, could not be resolved remotely in a conference call.</p>

<p>Her work would have to wait.</p>

<p>He glanced downwards at the small table in front of him. Both his MacBook and a half-eaten CafÃ© Acela sandwich competed for his attention. He sighed, shutting the laptopâ€™s lid so he could polish off his meager meal in quiet communion with the other solitary riders. It was not like he could prepare materials for a meeting he knew nothing about anyway.</p>

<p>He had left DC just two days ago, having attended lengthy discussions presidents from Tuesday to Wednesday between the chairman, the governors, and the other regional. Together, the committee had arrived at the anti-climactic decision to simply leave things as they were, along with a promise to revisit the matter in three months time. The ever so important benchmark rate was left untouched. His eyelids grew heavy as he reviewed the last decade of monetary decisions in his head. It was difficult to resist the soft lull of the drifting train.</p>

<p>Williams woke up just in time to see the train pull into Washington Union station. Dusting off the crumbs on his shirt, he made his way to the portico outside the entrance of the Main Hall for a taxi. Everything was running perfectly on schedule. In no time, he was cruising down the length of Constitution Avenue and riding past all the monuments and memorials of the National Mall.</p>

<p>The taxi dropped him off at the entrance of the Marriner S. Eccles buildingâ€”a towering, rectilinear behemoth of Georgia marble. While neither elegant nor quite ugly, it did cut a striking figure against the clear spring sky as it exuded a neoclassical boredom as unimaginative as the four floors of functionaries who filled it. In a city teeming with ornate symbols of power, perhaps it was only natural that the real thing would be found in an otherwise unremarkable structure.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™m back,â€ Williams whispered to himself.
The chairman was already waiting by the time he reached the conference room. The ambience reminded him of a very austere kindergarten, where each committee member customarily sat behind his or her emblazoned nameplate on the vast wooden table. At the center, of course, was Chairman Powell, flanked by Governors Clarida, Quarles, Bowman, and Brainard, or as they knew each otherâ€”Jay, Richard, Randy, Miki, and Lael. The governors were absent todayâ€”as were all of the usual observers and hangers-on inserted in the name of â€œtransparencyâ€â€”even as their names shone brightly on the table.</p>

<p>I need your strength. The kind of person who would respond to such an out of the way call like you did.</p>

<p>Your grandmother</p>

<p>scrolled through the news.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m sorry. I thought you were at the Capitol</p>

<p>â€œHi John,â€ Powell greeted him half-heartedly. â€œThanks for coming all the way here from New York.â€</p>

<p>â€œNo problem at all,â€ Williams lied as he closed the door behind him, sealing off the room. â€œNice to see you again.â€</p>

<p>Powell remained grim. Williams mustered a smile to a limited degree of success and took a seat across from the chairman, next to an unguarded Poland Spring bottle.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™m sure you have many questions for me,â€ Powell began. Any note of worry had been wrung cleanly from his voice. He now spoke with the same gravitas he applied to his media appearances, when he communicated the committeeâ€™s esoteric decisions to the implacable outside world.</p>

<p>â€œYes,â€ Williams he nodded. â€œI would like to know why am I here.â€</p>

<p>â€œTo understand that,â€ Powell said. â€œYou must first understand why we are here.â€</p>

<p>The greying chairman pulled out a sheaf of papers and slid them across the table. It was a typewritten monograph with the nondescript title: A Review of Anticipatory Systems. There was no author indicated either. As Williams thumbed through the text, Powellâ€™s watchful expression delivered him for a moment back to the ordeals of graduate school, sweating in front of his dissertation committee.</p>

<p>Williams looked up as he approached the end of the last chapter. Powellâ€™s eyes were twinkling back at him. â€œDo you have a question for me now?â€
â€œThis is certainly interesting,â€ Williams said. â€œBut Iâ€™m not sure why this is relevant.â€</p>

<p>â€œArenâ€™t financial systems a type of anticipatory system?â€ Powell said.</p>

<p>â€œWell, yes.â€ Williams read from the opening paragraph. â€œAn anticipatory system must have three parts: itself, a predictive model of its own future, and a mechanism to act upon itself based on that model. Examples can be found in biology, finance, psychology, and any other field concerning behavior.â€
Powell nodded. â€œAnd when you were reading it, didnâ€™t something feel odd to you?â€</p>

<p>It was certainly an odd situation to be reading an anonymous paper of undisclosed origin while being intently scrutinized. But that was not what Powell was getting at.</p>

<p>â€œYes,â€ Williams said. â€œIt feels intentionally incomplete.â€</p>

<p>â€œThe original German manuscript of the Review had to be smuggled across the Atlantic into the hands of the New York Fed,â€ Powell said. â€œTo evade Axis censors, it was vital that it appeared as no more than an innocuous mathematical text.â€</p>

<p>It was not rare for genius to be entwined with revolution, Williams thought, and the Review certainly suggested both.</p>

<p>The writing circled around four core insights.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">Suppose there was a network</span>  of individual anticipatory systems that interacted with each other. The predictive model of each individual would depend not only on the behavior, but also on the predictive models of its neighboring individuals, much like a vast multidimensional game of poker.</p>

<p>However, it was equally valid to take the opposite view of the situation, not as a network of individuals but as a network of the models themselves interacting through the systems. The predictive models could be seen as souls who possessed the individual systems whose behavior they guided. Once formed by the systems, these emergent models shaped the systems themselves. A poker game not between humans, but between different poker playing strategies that interacted through human hands. Such was the first insight.</p>

<p>Although the models were in every sense as â€œrealâ€ as the actual systems themselves, there was an important difference. Systems behaved in a strictly causal way, with one interaction leading to and causing another. On the other hand, it was impossible to apply the framework of causality to models in any meaningful way. The â€œmeta-behaviorâ€ of prediction models playing off against each other was timeless. In a game of rock, paper, scissors, the metaphysical rock beats scissors, now, then, and forever. As such, the meta-behavior of prediction models was also far more predictable and manipulable than the behavior of actual systems. Such was the second insight.</p>

<p>Even if the myriad interactions between individuals in a crowd could be exhaustively catalogued, there was no easy to predict the collective behavior of these individuals once the number of individuals became overwhelming. On the other hand, it was possible to set up games, where interacting systems of rules and strategies would converge on completely predictable outcomes no what what happened. For a example, a tournament may be set up such that only one individual wins, even if such a winning condition were not explicitly dictated. Such was the third insight.</p>

<p>As elegant as it was, the dual view of networks of individuals as networks of models was more of a mathematical abstraction than a true description of the physical world, where causality reigned supreme. However, as the numbers of individuals in the networks increased and their interconnections were wound ever more tightly, the better this approximation would be. The more the models could come to life. Such was its final insight.</p>

<p>In such a world, if it could be achieved, the difference between prediction and actionâ€”between prophesy and futureâ€”was a meaningless one.</p>

<p>â€œWhy was the Review sent to us?â€ Williams asked. â€œAnd why did we keep it?â€</p>

<p>â€œThe author of the Review had a dream of a peaceful world,â€ Powell said.</p>

<p>â€œAnd we, the means to achieve her dream. Because we control the most liquid predictive market in the world, connecting traders and investors across the world who interact daily with each other. The new Fed was born in the flames of the Second World War. The moment Marriner Eccles received the translation of her manuscript in 1941.â€</p>

<p>â€œWhat is the Fed actually doing?!â€ Williams stood from his seat.
â€œYou cannot even imagine,â€ Powell shook as he placed his eyeglasses on the table. â€œWhat it means to control the yield curve.â€
Yield curve control? Wasnâ€™t that the newfangled policy that the Bank of Japan had first rolled out. Williams looked at Powell blankly.</p>

<p>â€œWait.â€</p>

<p>â€œYes?â€ 
â€œThe yield curve does not predict central bank intervention,â€ Williams muttered to himself. â€œThe change in the yield curve IS central bank intervention.â€
Powell laughed heartily as he saw the flash of realization over Williamsâ€™ face. He had been waiting patiently for this moment.</p>

<p>â€œThe yield curve whispers to us from the future,â€ Powell said. â€œBecause we have set up a massive anticipatory network according to the conditions set forth in the Review. A network that allows is to send messages to our past selves.â€</p>

<p>This was all so ridiculous to Williams, but not much more so than the retconned creation mythology of the Federal Reserve. He had nursed his own private doubts about the dual mandate of late, views which he dared not air in public.</p>

<p>â€œThe Federal Reserve acts as the eyes of the Republic, providing advance warning of threats to our democracy,â€ Powell said proudly. â€œOur stewardship of capital markets is of secondary concern.â€</p>

<p>Williams plopped back into his chair, ready to receive his true mission.</p>

<p>â€œThe the treasury market transmission network is still an imperfect one, the financial equivalent of a smoke signals,â€ Powell explained. â€œWe communicate by inverting the yield curve, and encode information in the timing and the choice of tenors that get inverted. Anything more complicated than that becomes garbled when you try to send messages years back in time.â€</p>

<p>â€œLast December, the three year and five year inverted, followed by the two year and five year a day afterward. According to our protocol, this pattern signals mass unrest within two years, with more information to follow. We proceeded by calibrating our monetary antennae by adjusting the federal feds rate upward until we received a follow-up signal. Which we received just this morning, when the three month and ten year flipped. America is going to be hit with a global pandemic.</p>

<p>â€œWeâ€™ve tried to warn the executive branch about it. However, unlike in the past, the executive branch is not responding as decisively to the intelligence as we had hoped. The situation is bleak. This is the first time we have operated alone. And thereâ€™s only so much the eyes of the Republic can do.â€</p>

<p>â€œDoes no one else know?â€ Williams asked.</p>

<p>â€œThe true purpose of the Federal Reserve is only revealed to the President, a few of his or her trusted advisors, and me,â€ Powell said. â€œAnd Iâ€™m breaching protocol by telling you.â€</p>

<p>Powell rubbed his sleepless eyes. â€œBut I believe that thereâ€™s a special destiny that comes with working at the New York Fed.â€</p>

<p>â€œThanks but,â€ Williams said. â€œIâ€™m not sure how I can help.â€</p>

<p>â€œTo be frank with you, Iâ€™m not exactly sure what to do either. But Iâ€™ve always known you to have a good head on your shoulders. Weâ€™ll think of something.â€</p>

<p>â€œOkay.â€ His boss could be overbearing sometimes, Williams thought.
â€œAnd weâ€™re going to have to meet in person more often than our quarterly FOMC committee meetings.â€</p>

<p>â€œSure,â€ Williams agreed with a sense of dread. Even with the weight of the country on his shoulders, he did not look forward to long commutes to the capital. â€œWhatever it takes.â€</p>

<p>The two men stared at each other from across the table for a while, before Williams interrupted. â€œSo now what?â€</p>

<p>â€œItâ€™s only six,â€ Powell said, glancing at the clock. â€œAre you free to join me for an early supper? My treat, of course.â€</p>

<p>â€œLet me tell my family then,â€ Williams said. â€œAnd I will get to choose the place this time.â€</p>

<p>Powell laughed again as he reached for his messenger bag to go.</p>

<p>â€œSo itâ€™s all a waste of time then?â€ Williams asked as he rose from the chair, cradling the Review underneath his arm.</p>

<p>â€œWhat?â€</p>

<p>â€œAll the discussion about the economy and rate hikes and rate cuts? Itâ€™s all just a front for fiddling with the dials on a massive time machine.â€</p>

<p>â€œCorrect.â€</p>

<p>â€œNo wonder it never made any sense.â€</p>

<p>Williams held open the door dutifully for Powell.</p>

<p>â€œYou knowâ€¦â€ The chairman hesitated thoughtfully at the exit. â€œThe plunge protection team actually exists.â€</p>

<p>â€œYea I know, the Working Group on Financial Markets.â€</p>

<p>â€œNo, not that one. Thereâ€™s a group of Fed traders who manipulate spooz around two and three AM in the morning. Itâ€™s a short-distance communication system that sends messages months rather than years into the past.â€</p>

<p>â€œSheesh, what else are you hiding?â€</p>

<p>Powell winked. â€œThe Eccles building is very large for a reason.â€</p>

<p><span class="newthought">Fin.</span></p>

<p>1) consider changing the story to be about a secondary character uncovering a mystery instead of the NY Fed chair?
2) the part about the complex systems thing is hard to follow
(Not necessarily good or bad)</p>

<p>3) consider adding B-plot (fed pres has to get flowers for his wife kind of BS, something for him to think about) - humanize and add conflict</p>

<p>Even though she was just a recent intern, he had asked her to go with him to the committee meeting at the capital.</p>

<p>She had caught him uncharacteristically slacking off yesterday from the corner of her eye, framed in the darkened reflection of her phone. Just quietly standing in the side. Not working. She pretended not to notice. The man rarely took interest in anything other than work and was consumed by the responsibilities and duties of heading the New York office. But Williams could be odd sometimes. Perhaps he was just staring into space.</p>

<p>And suddenly, Williams, her stiff boss, asked her out for lunch today. He had done so in his characteristically awkward fashion.
She was worried. Not for herself, but for him.
Something was not right with her boss.
As she pondered his invitation,
She wondered if his expression, which she had interpreted as shyness, was instead a look of silent horror.</p>

<p>As she walked back to her workstation, she tried to piece together the events of the last week.
Williams had become absent-minded ever since he returned from his trip to the capital two days ago.
He clammed up when she asked him how the committee meeting went.</p>

<p>Drained.
â€œHow was the powwow with the Powell?â€ she asked him on Thursday morning. 
How was the, she ribbed him about it. The kind of humor that made him chortle. But A face of indescribable horror.</p>

<p>At first it was just creepy
He had stood in front of her desk, mouth slightly open as if to ask for a favor. Hesitating for a moment, he brushed off .
She watched him for a moment before walking back to her desk.</p>

<p>He had caught him staring into her cubicle, from . She had pretended not to notice.
wasnâ€™t sure what to make of it. 
She popped
â€œYea.â€ He sat in his chair, slightly rattled.</p>

<p>He would stopped by her desk, as if to ask for a favor, and t hesitate and then proceed back to his office as if nothing had happened.
At first she worried.
For his sake.
He had grown forgetful. She had , and didnâ€™t like. 
Ever since the conclave in the capital.
E
Her intuition was more flexible.
Working on Wall Street. Working
Williams did not understand.</p>

<p>Long ago,  But now he was the regional president of the New York Fed, while she was just another rank-and-file economist in the lower echelons of the Division of Financial Stability.</p>

<p>As Williams thumbed through the text, interspersed with mathematical notation.</p>

<p>And the most curious puzzle of all</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The greying chairman pulled out a sheaf of papers and slid them across the table.  Powellâ€™s watchful expression delivered him for a moment back to the ordeals of graduate school, sweating in front of his dissertation committee.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m so sorry,</p>

<p>grasping at straws, I need someone to trust</p>

<p>â€œIs this about the papers you sent me?â€</p>

<p>â€œSorry?â€</p>

<p>â€œNever mind,â€ she stirred her tea.</p>

<p>Alex took off her headphones and rested them on her neck.</p>

<p>â€œWhat for?â€</p>

<p>as if it were the most normal</p>

<p>â€œOh, for real?â€</p>

<p>â€œDo you need something?â€</p>

<p>â€œNope.â€ Williams stood meekly in the doorway. â€œJust passing by.â€</p>

<p>â€œWell, you look like you want to talk.â€</p>

<p>â€œNot really,â€ Williams said as he walked into the room, carefully stepping past the crates of papers piled high on the office floor.</p>

<p>took a drawn-out sip from his morning coffee. â€œMaybe Iâ€™ll catch you later.â€</p>

<p>â€œSure, Iâ€™ll be here all day if you need me.â€</p>

<p>Williams, who looked about to turn away, suddenly asked. â€œWhat are you up to now, anyway?â€</p>

<p>Williams  When he reached her desk, he leaned over to peer at her monitor, as if to catch a glimpse of her mind at work.</p>

<p>â€œYou look busy,â€ he said of the teeming mass of open tabs.</p>

<p>He set the cup on the edge of the table as he adjusted the strap on the laptop bag slung over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Alex said as she playfully shooed her bossâ€”or rather, the boss of <em>her</em> bossâ€”away.</p>

<p>â€œAww, back to work then.â€ Williams slung a laptop bag over his shoulder and marched back towards the entrance, weaving through the crates of papers piled high on the office floor.</p>

<p>Williams had always been impressed with her intellect and contrarian streak. Despite that, he kept abreast of her work. He was always quick to email her comments on her latest working papers and occasionally dropped by unexpectedly.</p>

<p>She was just about to return to revising her latest draft when her hand bumped against something, knocking it over. It was Williamsâ€™ coffeeâ€”he had run off in a hurry and left it behind.</p>

<p>â€œ<em>Shit</em>,â€ she hissed as she yanked her keyboard away to protect it from the fallout.</p>

<p>But the paper cup simply rolled off the table onto the carpet. Setting down the keyboard, she bent over to pick it up. As she pried its lid open, she saw that the cup was entirely empty with no trace of ever having contained liquid inside. Instead, there was a wadded-up napkin, which she flattened out on her table to uncover a message scrawled out in smudged ballpoint.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The handwriting was unmistakably his. Long ago. It was back in their Stanford days, when Williams organized the annual scavenger hunt for the economics department, leaving a series of cryptic notes written in code. This time, the note was in plain English, but far more mysterious.</p>
