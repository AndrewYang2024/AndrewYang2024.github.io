<p><span class="newthought"> Alex was a master of the coffee nap. </span>  Despite her worn-down state, she could gauge the depth of her exhaustion in precise degrees of caffeine. Three to be exact. A triple-shot of espresso would be enough to nudge her awake after ten beautiful minutes of sleep.</p>

<p>Her home office was furnished with a pristine espresso machine, which stood proudly as the bastion of her productivity. Although her skill with the Swiss-made instrument was by no means impressive, the shots she pulled still surpassed what passed for â€œjoeâ€ in her adopted country. Bad coffee was just one of many indignities that America inflicted on her Continentally-raised palateâ€”a disgusting substance whose only redeeming quality was convenience.</p>

<p>But the espresso machine was out of commission that night, waiting on parts that she had ordered the week before. Instead, she walked over to the refrigerator in the kitchenette and cracked open a bottle of cold brew. It was as if lowering the temperature had induced a phase transition, transmuting what was once non-ingestable into something more tolerable. The cold numbed her tongue to the taste as she forced down the mud-brown liquid. Having flooded her gullet with sufficient stimulus, along with a few tea biscuits, she stumbled onto her bed. The cool spring night was bleeding into dawn, and the birds perched outside of her bedroom window were already calling in the new morning. Without a care for them or for the world, she lay flat on her belly and slept.</p>

<p><span class="newthought"> Alex dreamt that she was flying under a moonless sky. </span>  Her arms dangled loosely in the shape of a <em>V</em>, passively generating lift. Flying felt much like swimming, she thought, without the exercise. She was searching for her companions, a flock of albatrosses that had merged with her not long ago, but they proved difficult to spot in the rolling fog. The birds had simply melted away into the murkiness of the sea mist.</p>

<p>Though nowhere seen, their wingbeats reverberated through the moist night air, leaving an audible trail to follow. She cocked her head to triangulate the source of the sound, which seemed to arrive uniformly from every direction. It was then that she realized that the sound came directly from above her. It was a balmy night, she observed. Her feathery friends were probably circling overhead, riding the rising thermals over the sea. She kicked her feet out for an extra burst of speed and took off in a corkscrew. Their wingbeats grew louder as she climbed higher. Her hair was whipped wildly around, its strands dancing from her scalp, as she rounded each coil of the spiral.</p>

<p>The air erupted into a chorus of birdsong when she finally shot out from the sea fog, greeting her late arrival to the party. Inundated by the raucous welcome, Alex fell into a dazeâ€”the moonless sky a starry tapestry above her head, the mist a damp carpet below her feet.</p>

<p>Yet there was a small detail that bothered Alex and interrupted her suspension within the moment. The albatrosses, their beaks opening and closing in rhythm, warbled in the familiar chirping of tree-bound sparrows rather than the shrieking calls of roving seabirds she expected. As pinpricks of starlight widened into glimmers of sunbeams, she realized that they were not chirping hello, but rather goodbye. Perched on the threshold of wakefulness, she hesitated, wanting just to stay a little longer in the world of her dreams.</p>

<p>It was then that she stalled.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the wind no longer whipped against her face. Waving wildly, she tried to latch onto the invisible currents that had carried her up, but their slippery strands simply parted at her fingertips. The chirping of the birds grew to a fever pitch as they gawked in horror.</p>

<p>Alex plummeted straight into the depths of the fog, screaming as she contemplated the horror of slamming into the ocean at terminal velocity.</p>

<p>But the pain never came. There was no splash. Not even a sense of where atmosphere ended and water began. At the end of her descent, she found herself floating atop a shadowy, endless pool of water. Alex scratched her nose and looked around. The fog and the birds were all gone, leaving behind an immaculate sunrise.</p>

<p>â€œ<em>Wo ist alles hin?</em>â€ she whispered.</p>

<p>The ocean murmured back in reply.</p>

<p><em>Brrrrrrrrr</em></p>

<p>It was the murmur of eddies toppling over each other across the mirror of water.</p>

<p><em>Brrrrrrrrr</em></p>

<p><label for="mf-id-1" class="margin-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="mf-id-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/img/a001.png" /><br /></span></p>

<p><span class="newthought"> The whirring of the printer woke Alex up. </span>  Without reaching for her phone, she reckoned that she had managed to oversleep on a workday. But that was not her immediate concern. Looking over the edge of her pillow, she could read the thin, squinty letters on the printerâ€™s small LED screen, which announced that a fax transmission from an unknown sender was underway. Strange, she thought. She did not remember ever configuring her desktop inkjet to receive faxes. Yet it continued to eject what appeared to be scanned pages from an ancient document into an accumulating heap of paper on the ground.</p>

<p>When the LED screen finally blinked off, she stepped into her slippers to gather and collate the mess.</p>

<p>The document was a typewritten monograph that bore the nondescript title, <em>A Review of Anticipatory Systems,</em> with no author indicated. Alex had seen the term before in graduate school, when she was completing her doctorate at Stanfordâ€™s Department of Economics. That was where Williams, her previous upperclassman and current boss, had also went. Anticipatory systems theory was just one of many intellectual rabbit-holes she had indulged in outside of her main academic tack. It brought back memories, both fond and otherwise, to see it again.</p>

<p>While thumbing through the sheaf of papers, she saw that pages seventeen and eighteen were missing.</p>

<p>Alex circled the room and then checked underneath the bed. There they were, along with a printed note.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Alexandra,</p>

  <p>Please come to Eccles Conference Room 3C today:</p>

  <p>3:00 PM March 22</p>

  <p>Tell no one else about this.</p>

  <p>â€”Jay</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She wondered if the message was actually intended for her. It could also be an elaborate prank, she reasoned. Her profession attracted the ire of online cranks who wished its practitioners (mostly metaphorical) harm. But if this Jay were actually <em>that</em> Jay, this invitation would be a direct order from her bossâ€™s bossâ€”the chairman himselfâ€”that she could not ignore.</p>

<p>It was almost noon. She checked her notifications. Twenty-seven minutes ago, a colleague had asked her where she was and if she could look over his data analysis after lunch. Biting her lip, she tapped out a terse reply.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I apologize for the short notice. But due to a personal emergency, I will not be in the office today.</p>

  <p>I will still be in contact through email. Feel free to call my cell if you need me urgently.</p>

  <p>Regards,</p>

  <p>Alex</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She hit send on the message and shoved the <em>Review</em> into her backpack. If she were to honor this summons, she would have to leave now. It was presumptuous of â€œJayâ€ to ask her to simply drop everything and hop on the next train from New York to DC, but she would oblige. What bothered her was not the abruptness of the request. It was the mystery of it, which tortured Alex with her own native sense of curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="newthought"> Williams glanced downwards at the small table in front of him.</span>  Both his MacBook and a half-eaten CafÃ© Acela sandwich competed for his attention. He sighed, shutting the laptopâ€™s lid so he could finish his meager meal in quiet communion with the other solitary Amtrak riders. It was not like he could prepare materials for a surprise meeting he knew nothing about anyway.</p>

<p>All he had to go on was the anonymous document tucked under his arm. The chairman had referenced it during their conversation earlier.</p>

<p>â€œDid you read it?â€ the chairman had asked. â€œThe <em>Review</em>?â€</p>

<p>â€œYou mean the one you handed to me on Tuesday? Yea, I did. Itâ€™sâ€¦ strange.â€</p>

<p>Although some of the mathematical notations were unfamiliar and, in some respects, archaic, every sentence of it was sharply written, even if not immediately comprehensible. Having perused it multiple times, he still could not follow every single one of its threads. Its quizzical nature reminded him of Alex, whose keen wit had mesmerized him since their Stanford daysâ€”a secret but purely intellectual crush on his part.</p>

<p>â€œGood, good.â€</p>

<p>â€œWhy do you ask?â€</p>

<p>â€œCome to the usual meeting room as soon as possible and youâ€™ll find out soon enough. Iâ€™ll be waiting.â€</p>

<p>â€œSorry, Iâ€™m not in town anymore. Iâ€™m back in my regular office now.â€</p>

<p>â€œOh, my apologies. I thought you were planning to stay for a bit to sort out the rest?â€</p>

<p>â€œI really did want to, but I had to return. Say, could we do a conference call instead?â€</p>

<p>â€œNo. I need to speak to you in person. Just you and me.â€</p>

<p>â€œThree then. I can make it to you at three.â€</p>

<p>â€œOkay, Iâ€™ll see you then.â€</p>

<p>â€œAnything else?â€</p>

<p>â€œThat is all. Goodbye.â€</p>

<p>It was already an inauspicious morning. The ten year had just dipped below the three month tenor, and the chairmanâ€™s unexpected phone call lent the yield curve inversion an almost sinister edge. Were the two things somehow connected? He rejected the idea. Curve inversions were something for traders to fret about. Surely there were more important matters to summon him over. Matters that, for some reason, could not be resolved remotely in a conference call.</p>

<p>He had left DC just two days ago, having suffered through marathon discussions from Tuesday to Wednesday between the chairman, the governors, and the other regional presidents. Together, the committee had arrived at the anti-climactic decision to leave the bedrock benchmark rate untouched, along with a promise to revisit the matter in three months time. His eyelids grew heavy as he reviewed the last decade of monetary decisions in his head. It grew difficult to resist the soft lull of the drifting train.</p>

<p>Williams woke up just in time to see the train pull into Washington Union station. Dusting off the crumbs on his shirt, he made his way to the portico outside of the entrance of the Main Hall to hail a taxi. Everything was running perfectly on schedule. In no time, he was cruising down the length of Constitution Avenue and riding past the monuments and memorials of the National Mall.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™m back,â€ Williams whispered to himself.</p>

<p>The taxi dropped him off at the entrance of the Marriner S. Eccles building. Neither quite elegant nor quite ugly, the rectilinear behemoth of Georgia marble cut a striking figure against the clear spring sky. In a city teeming with ornamented symbols of power, it was perhaps only natural that the real thing would be found in an otherwise unadorned structure. To its critics, the Eccles building exuded a neoclassical boredom as unimaginative as the four floors of functionaries who staffed it.</p>

<p>The chairman was already waiting by the time Williams reached the conference room. The ambience reminded him of a very austere kindergarten, where each committee member customarily sat behind his or her emblazoned nameplate at the yawning oak table. At the center, of course, was Chairman Powell, flanked by Governors Clarida, Quarles, Bowman, and Brainard. Or as they knew each otherâ€”Jay, Richard, Randy, Miki, and Lael. Although their names still flashed brightly on the table, the other governors were conspicuously absentâ€”along with all the usual observers and hangers-on inserted in the name of transparency.</p>

<p>â€œHello John,â€ Powell greeted him half-heartedly, turning grim. â€œThank you for coming all the way here from New York.â€</p>

<p>â€œNo problem at all,â€ Williams replied as he closed the door behind him, sealing off the room. â€œNice to see you again.â€</p>

<p>Williams mustered a smile and took his seat across from the chairman.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™m sure you have many questions for me,â€ Powell began. Even alone, he spoke with the same gravitas he applied to his media appearancesâ€”a patient voice honed for the communication of the committeeâ€™s esoteric decisions to an implacable outside world.</p>

<p>â€œYes,â€ Williams nodded. â€œI do.â€</p>

<p>â€œYou work with Alexandra Ender, donâ€™t you?â€</p>

<p>â€œYes. Officially, sheâ€™s still an intern, but sheâ€™s basically my right-hand woman when it comes to policy. Wicked sharp.â€ Williams stopped himself before gushing further.</p>

<p>â€œSo you trust her?â€</p>

<p>â€œAbsolutely, weâ€™ve known each other for years.â€</p>

<p>â€œThatâ€™s good to know. I may need someone like her in the future.â€</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™d hate to have her go,â€ Williams laughed. â€œBut Iâ€™d be happy to leave you her number and email.â€</p>

<p>â€œNo need,â€ Powell brushed him off. â€œI prefer more discreet means of contact.â€</p>

<p>Before Williams could press further, Powellâ€™s phone buzzed on the table.</p>

<p>â€œYes?â€ Powell answered as he picked it up. â€œOkay, send her up to me.â€</p>

<p><span class="newthought"> Alex ascended the spiral staircase towards the third floor,</span>  unsure what lay in wait for her at the end. The stairs brought her to a well-lit corridor. Following the signage, she arrived at a pair of broad, paneled doors. She knocked hesitantly.</p>

<p>â€œCome in.â€</p>

<p>As she nudged the door ajar, she caught Powellâ€™s eyes peering into her own.</p>

<p>â€œNow that all of us are together,â€ Powell said approvingly. â€œWe may begin.â€</p>

<p>â€œAlex?â€</p>

<p>â€œWait, John? Youâ€™re here too?â€ Alex looked at Williams. â€œWhatâ€™s this all about?â€</p>

<p>â€œI have just as much of a clue as you do.â€</p>

<p>â€œThere, there,â€ Powell smiled. â€œSettle down.â€</p>

<p>Alex took up a chair beside Williams and plopped her copy of the <em>Review</em> on the table.</p>

<p>â€œNow if you may,â€ the greying chairman folded his hands. â€œIâ€™d like to know what you thought of it.â€</p>

<p>Alex swallowed back a lump. â€œI was in a bit of rush, so I could only give it a cursory read.â€</p>

<p>â€œBut when you were reading it for the first time,â€ Powellâ€™s eyes were twinkling back at her. â€œDid something feel odd to you?â€</p>

<p>Alex cleared her throat. â€œIt felt intentionallyâ€¦ incomplete? Iâ€™m also not sure why this was given to meâ€”â€</p>

<p>â€œArenâ€™t financial systems an example of an anticipatory system?â€ Powell interrupted.</p>

<p>â€œWell, yes.â€ Alex then quoted from the opening paragraph. â€œ<em>An anticipatory system must have three parts: itself, a predictive model of its own future, and a mechanism to act upon itself based on that model. Examples can be found in biology, finance, psychology, and any other field concerning collective behavior.</em>â€</p>

<p>â€œBut your intuition is correct. The text does conceal its true intentions,â€ Powell said. â€œThe document you hold before you is the translation of an original German manuscript that was smuggled across the Atlantic from the Viennese into the hands of the New York Fed. In order to evade Axis censors, it was vital that it appeared as no more than an innocuous mathematical text.â€</p>

<p>Not uncommon for genius to be entwined with revolution, Alex thought, and the <em>Review</em> certainly suggested both.</p>

<p>Powell continued, â€œIâ€™ll briefly review its core points, just to make sure we are all on the same page here.</p>

<p>â€œSuppose there exists a network of individual anticipatory systems that interact with each other. As with any interconnected network, the behavior of each individual always depends on the behavior of the others. But for anticipatory networks, the observed behavior of the others may matter less than what that behavior ultimately reveals about the internal predictive models of the other participants. To illustrate this point, a poker tournament can be won while keeping oneâ€™s hand face down. One only needs to read the faces of other players and infer their knowledge of the game from their reactions.</p>

<p>Playing the players, Alex thought. It amused her to think of the chairman as a piker.</p>

<p>â€œTaking this further, an anticipatory network may sometimes be better understood as a network of <em>models</em> rather than as a network of <em>individuals</em>. To continue my analogy, if people are gambling on the outcome of the tournament without seeing either the playersâ€™ faces or their hands, they perceive the event not as a game between poker players but between different poker-playing strategiesâ€”inferred from each playerâ€™s match historyâ€”acting through the conduit of human hands.</p>

<p>â€œFrom the gamblersâ€™ perspective, the strategies of each player are in every sense as â€˜realâ€™ as the players themselves. After all, the models are the â€˜thingâ€™ they are betting on and the humans merely vehicles. The perspective of the anticipatory systems analyst is much the same. The internal predictive models are as real as the underlying systems, and a network of individuals can be conceptualized as a network of models. They are duals. Fundamentally equivalent views that can be naturally exchanged for each other.</p>

<p>â€œBut duals are not identical. Although systems must behave in a strictly causal way, with one interaction leading to another, models do not. The framework of causality simply cannot be applied to the â€˜meta-behaviorâ€™ of models interacting with other models, because these interactions exist outside of time. To the question, â€˜when did rock beat scissors,â€™ one can only answer, â€˜whenever the rules of <em>rock, paper, scissors</em> were first conceivableâ€™â€”now, then, and forever.</p>

<p>â€œThis acausality has other consequences. Even when the myriad interactions between individuals in a crowd can be exhaustively catalogued, it is often impossible to predict their collective behavior once the number of individuals becomes overwhelming. Much like dealing with the sudden spread of an epidemic, it becomes impossible to trace the chains of causality. On the other hand, it is very easy to design gamesâ€”even games with very rich behaviorâ€”that always converge on completely predictable outcomes no matter how many players it has or how clever its players are. An example is the class of games whose rules do not explicitly specify a winner-take-all dynamic, but guarantee a single winner at the end nonetheless.</p>

<p>â€œYou and I know these games very well.â€ Powell said. â€œDonâ€™t we?â€</p>

<p>â€œItâ€™s not like you to beat around the bush.â€ Williams was tapping his foot. â€œWhat does this all mean to us? Why was it sent to us?â€</p>

<p>â€œI find that terrible things tend to happen when I speak plainly,â€ Powell retorted. â€œBut if you can indulge me for a little longer.â€</p>

<p>Alex looked anxiously between her two superiors. She had been quietly taking notes on the chairmanâ€™s words the whole time.</p>

<p>Powell continued, â€œI grant that everything Iâ€™ve said up to now sounds far removed from everyday life. And it would be, if not for the appendix on approximation theory.</p>

<p>â€œAn anticipatory network as I have described is still only just an approximation of anticipatory networks in the real world. The model-system duality that follows is but a convenient mathematical abstraction. But if certain conditions hold, this approximation becomes quite good and the duality has real implications.</p>

<p>â€œFor example, if we are able to gather enough people, make their thoughts and actions highly dependent on each other, and then train them such that they respond as much to abstractions as they do to realities, then something interesting emerges. When they can no longer distinguish between symbolic manipulations and physical facts, the distinction between causal behavior and acausal meta-behavior is erased.</p>

<p>â€œIn such a situation the difference between prediction and actionâ€”between prophesy and futureâ€”is a meaningless one.â€</p>

<p>Alexâ€™s blood stirred. Everything was coming together now.</p>

<p>â€œThis was the dream of Astrid Ender, who wrote the <em>Review</em> and arranged for its delivery,â€ Powell explained. â€œYour great-grandmother, Alex.â€</p>

<p>â€œWow,â€ Williams gasped, looking at her with newfound admiration.</p>

<p>â€œThe Enders are a long intellectual lineage dating back to the Austro-Hungarians,â€ Powell explained. â€œBefore their collapse, they were quite well-known in monetary circles. It was only a matter of time before Astridâ€™s descendant would make her way back into the trade.â€</p>

<p>The two menâ€™s scrutiny made Alex shift in her seat. Much to her relief, they quickly returned to their original discussion.</p>

<p>â€œDo you understand now,â€ Powell asked solemnly. â€œWhat it means to control the yield curve?â€</p>

<p>Williams stared blankly at Powell and felt left behind. He could not comprehend how yield curve control, a newfangled policy from the Bank of Japan, fit into the picture.</p>

<p>â€œWhat?â€</p>

<p>â€œDonâ€™t you get it, John?â€ Alex said. â€œThe yield curve does not predict central bank intervention. The change in the yield curve <em>IS</em> central bank intervention.â€</p>

<p>Powell laughed heartily as he saw the flash of realization over Williamsâ€™s face. He had been waiting patiently for this moment.</p>

<p>â€œThe yield curve whispers to us from the future,â€ Powell said. â€œBecause my predecessors have created an anticipatory network that satisfies the conditions set forth in the <em>Review</em>. A machine that can pull forward the eternal future into the present.â€</p>

<p>â€œYou had me at acausality,â€ Alex said. â€œIf I understand correctly, the treasury market allows us to send messages to our past selves.â€</p>

<p>Powell nodded approvingly. â€œThis is the true history of the modern Fed, born amid the flames of the Second World War. From the moment Marriner Stoddard Eccles received an anonymous manuscript in 1941. This is why we control the most liquid predictive market in the world and train a global network of traders and investors to do our bidding.â€</p>

<p>This was all so ridiculous to Williams, but less so to Alex. She had nursed her own private doubts about the Federal Reserveâ€™s mandate of late, opinions which she dared not air in public. The retconned creation mythology of the Federal Reserve embodied by the dual-but-actually-triple mandate had always struck her as a theologico-monetary Nicene Creed.</p>

<p>â€œThe Federal Reserve acts as the eyes of the Republic to provide advance warning of threats to our democracy,â€ Powell said proudly. â€œOur stewardship of capital markets is of only secondary concern.â€</p>

<p>Overwhelmed, Williams sank into his chair.</p>

<p>â€œThe treasury market transmission network we have is still an imperfect one. Basically the financial equivalent of smoke signals,â€ Powell explained. â€œWe communicate by inverting the yield curve and the information is encoded in the timing and magnitude of the inversion. Anything more complicated than that becomes garbled when you try to send messages years back in time.</p>

<figure><figcaption></figcaption><img src="/assets/img/Inversion.png" /></figure>

<p>â€œLast December, the spread between the three and five year tenors inverted. According to our operating manuals, this shape signaled that a historical-level event is about to occur at the beginning of 2020, details pending. Following protocol, we honed the resolution of our monetary antennae by gradually hiking the federal funds rate. We had to stop because the pressure on capital markets became overwhelming, but that ultimately didnâ€™t matter. We received the main message shortly thereafter, when the three month and ten year flipped this morning.â€</p>

<p>â€œIs it the Big One?â€ William whispered.</p>

<p>â€œOh, thereâ€™ll be a massive deflationary shock alright,â€ Powell said. â€œBut thatâ€™s not our main problem. The shock will be caused by an environmental catastrophe with global consequences. The shape of the curve is somewhat ambiguous because weâ€™re not seeing things at full resolution, but it suggests that that the source of the event is somewhere in East Asia, perhaps China.â€</p>

<p>â€œWill there be a follow-up message?â€ Alex asked. â€œWe have at most nine months to prepare and it would help to narrow down the range of possibilities.â€</p>

<p>â€œThere wonâ€™t be. Once we get a shock, we have to shut down transmissions and return to our role as liquidity provider,â€ Powell responded. â€œWhich only leaves us with enough time to send an advance warning and then the main message.â€</p>

<p>An air of uncertainty settled in the room. Alex asked, â€œso what does â€˜environmentalâ€™ cover?â€</p>

<p>â€œItâ€™s a fairly long list. All the way from significant astronomical impact event, tsunami, climate-induced famine,â€ Powell rattled off a series of scenarios, â€œâ€¦ to a global pandemic. Iâ€™m no epidemiologist, but Iâ€™ve heard from experts that we are overdue for a flu pandemic.â€</p>

<p>Williams and Alex sat quietly, hoping for some shred of good news.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™ve tried to warn the executive branch about it but the current occupants are not responding as decisively as I had hoped. Maybe they do not want to sow panic, but I am not sure. This is the first time the Fed has operated alone and thereâ€™s only so much that being the eyes of the Republic can do.â€</p>

<p>â€œDoes no one else know?â€ Williams asked.</p>

<p>â€œOther than me, the true purpose of the Federal Reserve is revealed only to the President, a few of his trusted advisors, my foreign counterparts, and previous Fed chairs,â€ Powell said. â€œAnd just so you know, Iâ€™m breaching protocol by talking to you both. Iâ€™m doing it because I believe that thereâ€™s a special destiny that comes with leading the New York Fed and the Ender line.â€</p>

<p>â€œThanks,â€ Williams said. â€œBut Iâ€™m not sure how I can help.â€</p>

<p>â€œMe neither,â€ Alex added.</p>

<p>â€œTo be frank with you, Iâ€™m not exactly sure what we should do either. But John, Iâ€™ve always known you to have a good head on your shoulders. And Alex, you showed resolve by responding quickly to my call. I know we can think of something together.â€</p>

<p>â€œOkay,â€ Williams agreed timidly. Powell could be overbearing at times.</p>

<p>â€œAnd weâ€™re going to have to meet in person, the three of us, more often than our quarterly FOMC committee meetings.â€</p>

<p>â€œSure.â€ The weight of the country on his shoulders, along with the burden of long commutes to the capital, brought Williams a sense of dread. â€œWhatever it takes.â€</p>

<p>â€œSo,â€ Powell asked. â€œAny questions?â€</p>

<p>Alex and Williams shook their heads mutely.</p>

<p>â€œOh, itâ€™s getting late now,â€ Powell said, glancing over his watch. â€œWould either of you care to join me for an early supper? Some of Draghiâ€™s proteges will be there and it would be good to make introductions. Eventually, I will need to speak to Mario and warn him.â€</p>

<p>â€œI think Iâ€™ll pass, Iâ€™ve met all of them anyway,â€ Williams said reluctantly. â€œAlso need some time to process all of this.â€</p>

<p>â€œHave a good one, John,â€ Powell waved.</p>

<p>â€œYea, you too,â€ Williams replied, before slinking out of the conference room.</p>

<p>The chairman waited until Williams was out of earshot.</p>

<p>â€œI guess the Ender is staying?â€</p>

<p>The Ender nodded, pondering her newfound importance.</p>

<p>Powell tilted back in his chair and propped his feet on the table. â€œBetween you and me, I was never quite sure John would be up to the task.â€</p>

<p>â€œI know what what you mean,â€ Alex said, stifling a chuckle. â€œBut I think heâ€™ll be helpful. At least I hope so.â€</p>

<p>â€œAmen,â€ Powell quipped.</p>

<p>â€œSo itâ€™s all a waste of time then? All that discussion about the economy and quantitative easing and rate hikes and rate cuts. Itâ€™s really all just a front for fiddling with the dials on a massive time machine, right?â€</p>

<p>â€œCorrect.â€</p>

<p>â€œHah, no wonder it never made any sense to me. I figured you were all smarter than that.â€</p>

<p>â€œ<em>Some</em> of us,â€ Powell corrected. â€œNot everyone is in the know like we are.â€</p>

<p>â€œMakes me wonder what else are you hiding.â€</p>

<p>â€œWell, since you are going to have to find out anyway,â€ Powell hesitated thoughtfully. â€œThere is a Plunge Protection Team.â€</p>

<p>â€œThatâ€™s no secret, itâ€™s called the Working Group on Financial Markets, isnâ€™t it?â€</p>

<p>â€œNo, not that one. Thereâ€™s am actual bunch of algos that manipulate equity futures at around two to three in the morning. The price action inside that illiquid window allows us to establish a short-term communication system to sends messages days and months rather than years into the past without interfering with stocks too much.â€</p>

<p>â€œDidnâ€™t have that on my bingo card.â€</p>

<p>â€œThe Eccles building is large for a reason. It houses things that you cannot even imagine,â€ Powell winked. â€œAnd in due time, you will inherit all of its secrets.â€</p>

<p>Those secrets were her birthright, she thought, handed from across three generations. Alex smiled. Was it not the highest irony then, that the Federal Reserve was so indebted toâ€”of all peopleâ€”Austrian economists?</p>

Even though she was just a recent intern, he had asked her to go with him to the committee meeting at the capital.


She had caught him uncharacteristically slacking off yesterday from the corner of her eye, framed in the darkened reflection of her phone. Just quietly standing in the side. Not working. She pretended not to notice. The man rarely took interest in anything other than work and was consumed by the responsibilities and duties of heading the New York office. But Williams could be odd sometimes. Perhaps he was just staring into space.

And suddenly, Williams, her stiff boss, asked her out for lunch today. He had done so in his characteristically awkward fashion.
She was worried. Not for herself, but for him.
Something was not right with her boss.
As she pondered his invitation,
She wondered if his expression, which she had interpreted as shyness, was instead a look of silent horror.


As she walked back to her workstation, she tried to piece together the events of the last week.
Williams had become absent-minded ever since he returned from his trip to the capital two days ago.
He clammed up when she asked him how the committee meeting went. 

Drained.
â€œHow was the powwow with the Powell?â€ she asked him on Thursday morning. 
How was the, she ribbed him about it. The kind of humor that made him chortle. But A face of indescribable horror.

At first it was just creepy
He had stood in front of her desk, mouth slightly open as if to ask for a favor. Hesitating for a moment, he brushed off .
She watched him for a moment before walking back to her desk.

He had caught him staring into her cubicle, from . She had pretended not to notice.
wasnâ€™t sure what to make of it. 
She popped
â€œYea.â€ He sat in his chair, slightly rattled.

He would stopped by her desk, as if to ask for a favor, and t hesitate and then proceed back to his office as if nothing had happened.
At first she worried.
For his sake.
He had grown forgetful. She had , and didnâ€™t like. 
Ever since the conclave in the capital.
E
Her intuition was more flexible.
Working on Wall Street. Working
Williams did not understand.



Long ago,  But now he was the regional president of the New York Fed, while she was just another rank-and-file economist in the lower echelons of the Division of Financial Stability. 

As Williams thumbed through the text, interspersed with mathematical notation. 



And the most curious puzzle of all

The greying chairman pulled out a sheaf of papers and slid them across the table.  Powellâ€™s watchful expression delivered him for a moment back to the ordeals of graduate school, sweating in front of his dissertation committee.



Iâ€™m so sorry,

grasping at straws, I need someone to trust

â€œIs this about the papers you sent me?â€

â€œSorry?â€

â€œNever mind,â€ she stirred her tea.



Alex took off her headphones and rested them on her neck.

â€œWhat for?â€

as if it were the most normal

â€œOh, for real?â€



â€œDo you need something?â€

â€œNope.â€ Williams stood meekly in the doorway. â€œJust passing by.â€

â€œWell, you look like you want to talk.â€

â€œNot really,â€ Williams said as he walked into the room, carefully stepping past the crates of papers piled high on the office floor. 

took a drawn-out sip from his morning coffee. â€œMaybe Iâ€™ll catch you later.â€

â€œSure, Iâ€™ll be here all day if you need me.â€

Williams, who looked about to turn away, suddenly asked. â€œWhat are you up to now, anyway?â€

Williams  When he reached her desk, he leaned over to peer at her monitor, as if to catch a glimpse of her mind at work.

â€œYou look busy,â€ he said of the teeming mass of open tabs.



 He set the cup on the edge of the table as he adjusted the strap on the laptop bag slung over his shoulder.

 Alex said as she playfully shooed her bossâ€”or rather, the boss of *her* bossâ€”away.

â€œAww, back to work then.â€ Williams slung a laptop bag over his shoulder and marched back towards the entrance, weaving through the crates of papers piled high on the office floor.

Williams had always been impressed with her intellect and contrarian streak. Despite that, he kept abreast of her work. He was always quick to email her comments on her latest working papers and occasionally dropped by unexpectedly.

She was just about to return to revising her latest draft when her hand bumped against something, knocking it over. It was Williamsâ€™ coffeeâ€”he had run off in a hurry and left it behind.

â€œ*Shit*,â€ she hissed as she yanked her keyboard away to protect it from the fallout.



But the paper cup simply rolled off the table onto the carpet. Setting down the keyboard, she bent over to pick it up. As she pried its lid open, she saw that the cup was entirely empty with no trace of ever having contained liquid inside. Instead, there was a wadded-up napkin, which she flattened out on her table to uncover a message scrawled out in smudged ballpoint.

The handwriting was unmistakably his. Long ago. It was back in their Stanford days, when Williams organized the annual scavenger hunt for the economics department, leaving a series of cryptic notes written in code. This time, the note was in plain English, but far more mysterious.
