If you are curious about the funny looking designs at the upper-left corner, all the designs follow a common motif. The lush, calligraphic flourishes of theory are set against the rational, geometric forms of praxis,  and their combination is expressed in the bra-ket notation of quantum mechanics.  ⊕A linear functional〈f| (bra)  acts on a complex vector |v〉(ket) to create〈f|v〉(bra-ket)  Like theory and praxis, the spaces of bra’s and ket’s are dual spaces—both entangled with and separate from each other—destined to recombine in profound ways.\n\n⊕Main |  The duality of two single quotes—left and right— a rounded ink dot in the vague shape of an epsilon, and a sans-serif shape suggestive of a p for praxis.\n\n⊕About | Two question marks, with one slightly discombobulated\n⊕Tip Jar | A sickle with a flourish, driven through with a hammer\n⊕Index (or Archive) | An r and a stylized χ\n",

I discovered the blog at a critical moment in my life, and found their writing meaningful and hopeful in a time that lacked both. I still pepper my thought with phrases and stories borrowed from the ET canon: Magical Thinking and The Icarus Moment are some of my favorite classic ET articles. I can genuinely say that reading them changed me, and for the better.\n\n\n  Fragments of a vessel which are to be glued together must match one another in the smallest details, although they need not be like one another. In the same way a translation, instead of resembling the meaning of the original, must lovingly and in detail incorporate the original’s mode of signification, thus making both the original and the translation recognizable as fragments of a greater language, just as fragments are part of a vessel.\n\n  Walter Benjamin, Illuminations: Essays and Reflections\n\n\nIn financial writing, I found a fragment of something great and powerful. Since then I have continued to collect fragments from different sources, which in their variety and richness both depreciate and appreciate the value of my first find. Although I have moved on, ET remains one of my intellectual roots and serves as the oblique namesake of this personal repository of fiction, essays, and art. In a sense, this project of mine may be read as just another fragment—a loving subversion of the original Epsilon Theory.\n\n\n",
