        "content": "An alternative account of the events of Friday, March 22, 2019.\n\n Alex was a master of the coffee nap.   Even in her worn-down state, she could gauge the depth of her exhaustion in degrees of caffeine. Three to be exact. A triple-shot of espresso would be enough to nudge her awake gently after ten beautiful minutes of sleep.\n\nHer home office was furnished with a pristine espresso machine, which stood proudly as a bastion of productivity. Although her skill with the Swiss-made instrument was by no means impressive, the shots she pulled still surpassed what passed for “joe” in her adopted country. Bad coffee was just one of many indignities that America inflicted on her Continentally-raised palate—a disgusting substance whose only redeeming quality was its convenience.\n\nBut the espresso machine was out of commission that night, waiting on repairs she had put off from the week before. So she walked over to the kitchenette and cracked open a bottle of cold brew from the refrigerator.  The cold numbed her tongue to the taste as she forced it down. It was as if lowering the temperature induced a phase transition, turning what was once non-ingestable into something tolerable. Having flooded her gullet with sufficient stimulus and a few helpings of tea biscuits, she stumbled onto her bed. The cool spring night was bleeding into dawn, and the birds perched outside the bedroom window were already heralding the new morning. Without a care in the world, she lay flat on her belly and slept.\n\n Alex dreamt that she was flying.   Flying felt much like swimming, she thought, sans the exercise. Her arms dangled loosely at their sides, passively generating lift. She had company—a flock of albatrosses who escorted her through the soupy, gray fog and partied the murkiness with their wingbeats.\n\nThe birds departed one by one as the dream wore on, until a flock of dozens had finally dwindled into a handful of stragglers. She glided closer to this remaining group, into the vacant center of their formation. Up close, she was inundated by their chatter with each other, which sounded more like the lively chirps of nest-bound sparrows rather than the shrieking calls of roving seabirds.\n\nTheir chatter grew more exultant as they spiraled upwards into the sky, riding the thermals over the sea.\n\nThe fog began to recede, as did the outlines of her feathery friends, as they climbed higher. They were guiding her back outside, she realized. But she was having so much fun now—she wanted to stay in her dream-world. Perched on the threshold of wakefulness, she hesitated.\n\nIt was then that she stalled. She no longer felt the wind against her face. She waved her hands wildly, trying to latch onto the invisible currents of air that had buoyed her up here, but their slippery strands simply parted at her fingertips. The chirping of the birds crescendoed to a fever pitch as they gawked in horror. Alex plummeted straight into the depths of the fog, screaming as she contemplated the horror of slamming into the ocean at terminal velocity.\n\nAnd then she blinked.\n\nShe found herself levitated over a shadowy, endless pool of water. Alex scratched her nose and looked around. The fog and the birds were all gone.\n\n“Wo ist alles hin?” she whispered.\n\nThe ocean murmured back in reply.\n\nBrrrrrrrrr\n\nThe murmurs of eddies toppling over each other across a mirror of water.\n\nBrrrrrrrrr\n\n⊕\n\n The printer woke her up with its whirring.   Each whir was followed by the flapping sound of a letter-sized sheet being spat out and gliding towards the floor.\n\nWithout looking at her phone, Alex reckoned that she had overslept, but her more immediate concern was the accumulating heap of paper strewn about.  She did not recall ever setting up her printer as a fax machine, but somehow it was receiving what appeared to be scanned pages of a typewritten monograph. She slid out the output tray to catch the remainder of the still printing document and bent over the floor to gather the rest.\n\nIn total the monograph was forty-one black and white pages. It bore a nondescript title, A Review of Anticipatory Systems, with no author indicated. Alex had heard the term before in graduate school, when she was a PhD student at Stanford’s Department of Economics. That was where Williams, the regional president of the New York branch and her current boss, had also went for his doctorate. Anticipatory systems theory wasn’t part of the academic curricula, but rather an intellectual rabbit-hole of sorts that she indulged in at the time. Those memories returned to her as she thumbed through the pages, trying to pin down the document’s various threads as she unraveled its puzzle.\n\nI really should head out, Alex thought as the hours ticked by, but the Review was too engrossing. Although some of the mathematical notations were unfamiliar and, in some respects, archaic, every sentence of it was sharply written, even if not immediately comprehensible. She could not follow every single one of its threads, but such was the price of experiencing its brilliance for the first time.\n\nAnd on the last page was a message—not type-written this time— in bold letters.\n\n\n  BOARD’S OFFICES AT ECCLES 2F\n\n  3:00 PM TODAY MARCH 22\n\n  —Jay\n\n\nShe wondered if the message was truly intended for her. After all, she had never spoken with the chairman, let alone on first name terms. It could all be an elaborate, if oddly specific, prank for all she knew.\n\nIt was almost noon now, and she reached for her phone to check her notifications.\n\nI apologize for the short notice, she began typing out a reply. But due to a personal emergency, I will not be in the office today.\n\nI will still be in contact through email. Feel free to call my cell if you need me.\n\nRegards,\n\nAlexandra\n\nShe sent out the message and rushed to pack her bag. If she were to honor this meeting invitation, she would have to leave now as well.  It was a little crazy to simply drop everything and hop onto the next train to DC, but somehow that was in her blood. Moreover, the complete mystery of the request tortured Alex with her native sense of curiosity.\n\nIt was already an inauspicious day with the ten year dipping below the three month tenor that morning. The mysterious phone call lent the yield curve inversion an almost sinister edge. Were the two things somehow connected? He rejected the idea. That was something for the traders to fret about. Surely the Board of Governors had more important matters to summon him for. Matters that, for some reason, could not be resolved remotely in a conference call.\n\nHer work would have to wait.\n\nHe glanced downwards at the small table in front of him. Both his MacBook and a half-eaten Café Acela sandwich competed for his attention. He sighed, shutting the laptop’s lid so he could polish off his meager meal in quiet communion with the other solitary riders. It was not like he could prepare materials for a meeting he knew nothing about anyway.\n\nHe had left DC just two days ago, having attended lengthy discussions presidents from Tuesday to Wednesday between the chairman, the governors, and the other regional. Together, the committee had arrived at the anti-climactic decision to simply leave things as they were, along with a promise to revisit the matter in three months time. The ever so important benchmark rate was left untouched. His eyelids grew heavy as he reviewed the last decade of monetary decisions in his head. It was difficult to resist the soft lull of the drifting train.\n\nWilliams woke up just in time to see the train pull into Washington Union station. Dusting off the crumbs on his shirt, he made his way to the portico outside the entrance of the Main Hall for a taxi. Everything was running perfectly on schedule. In no time, he was cruising down the length of Constitution Avenue and riding past all the monuments and memorials of the National Mall.\n\nThe taxi dropped him off at the entrance of the Marriner S. Eccles building—a towering, rectilinear behemoth of Georgia marble. While neither elegant nor quite ugly, it did cut a striking figure against the clear spring sky as it exuded a neoclassical boredom as unimaginative as the four floors of functionaries who filled it. In a city teeming with ornate symbols of power, perhaps it was only natural that the real thing would be found in an otherwise unremarkable structure.\n\n“I’m back,” Williams whispered to himself.\nThe chairman was already waiting by the time he reached the conference room. The ambience reminded him of a very austere kindergarten, where each committee member customarily sat behind his or her emblazoned nameplate on the vast wooden table. At the center, of course, was Chairman Powell, flanked by Governors Clarida, Quarles, Bowman, and Brainard, or as they knew each other—Jay, Richard, Randy, Miki, and Lael. The governors were absent today—as were all of the usual observers and hangers-on inserted in the name of “transparency”—even as their names shone brightly on the table.\n\nI need your strength. The kind of person who would respond to such an out of the way call like you did.\n\nYour grandmother\n\nscrolled through the news.\n\nI’m sorry. I thought you were at the Capitol\n\n“Hi John,” Powell greeted him half-heartedly. “Thanks for coming all the way here from New York.”\n\n“No problem at all,” Williams lied as he closed the door behind him, sealing off the room. “Nice to see you again.”\n\nPowell remained grim. Williams mustered a smile to a limited degree of success and took a seat across from the chairman, next to an unguarded Poland Spring bottle.\n\n“I’m sure you have many questions for me,” Powell began. Any note of worry had been wrung cleanly from his voice. He now spoke with the same gravitas he applied to his media appearances, when he communicated the committee’s esoteric decisions to the implacable outside world.\n\n“Yes,” Williams he nodded. “I would like to know why am I here.”\n\n“To understand that,” Powell said. “You must first understand why we are here.”\n\nThe greying chairman pulled out a sheaf of papers and slid them across the table. It was a typewritten monograph with the nondescript title: A Review of Anticipatory Systems. There was no author indicated either. As Williams thumbed through the text, Powell’s watchful expression delivered him for a moment back to the ordeals of graduate school, sweating in front of his dissertation committee.\n\nWilliams looked up as he approached the end of the last chapter. Powell’s eyes were twinkling back at him. “Do you have a question for me now?”\n“This is certainly interesting,” Williams said. “But I’m not sure why this is relevant.”\n\n“Aren’t financial systems a type of anticipatory system?” Powell said.\n\n“Well, yes.” Williams read from the opening paragraph. “An anticipatory system must have three parts: itself, a predictive model of its own future, and a mechanism to act upon itself based on that model. Examples can be found in biology, finance, psychology, and any other field concerning behavior.”\nPowell nodded. “And when you were reading it, didn’t something feel odd to you?”\n\nIt was certainly an odd situation to be reading an anonymous paper of undisclosed origin while being intently scrutinized. But that was not what Powell was getting at.\n\n“Yes,” Williams said. “It feels intentionally incomplete.”\n\n“The original German manuscript of the Review had to be smuggled across the Atlantic into the hands of the New York Fed,” Powell said. “To evade Axis censors, it was vital that it appeared as no more than an innocuous mathematical text.”\n\nIt was not rare for genius to be entwined with revolution, Williams thought, and the Review certainly suggested both.\n\nThe writing circled around four core insights.\n\nSuppose there was a network  of individual anticipatory systems that interacted with each other. The predictive model of each individual would depend not only on the behavior, but also on the predictive models of its neighboring individuals, much like a vast multidimensional game of poker.\n\nHowever, it was equally valid to take the opposite view of the situation, not as a network of individuals but as a network of the models themselves interacting through the systems. The predictive models could be seen as souls who possessed the individual systems whose behavior they guided. Once formed by the systems, these emergent models shaped the systems themselves. A poker game not between humans, but between different poker playing strategies that interacted through human hands. Such was the first insight.\n\nAlthough the models were in every sense as “real” as the actual systems themselves, there was an important difference. Systems behaved in a strictly causal way, with one interaction leading to and causing another. On the other hand, it was impossible to apply the framework of causality to models in any meaningful way. The “meta-behavior” of prediction models playing off against each other was timeless. In a game of rock, paper, scissors, the metaphysical rock beats scissors, now, then, and forever. As such, the meta-behavior of prediction models was also far more predictable and manipulable than the behavior of actual systems. Such was the second insight.\n\nEven if the myriad interactions between individuals in a crowd could be exhaustively catalogued, there was no easy to predict the collective behavior of these individuals once the number of individuals became overwhelming. On the other hand, it was possible to set up games, where interacting systems of rules and strategies would converge on completely predictable outcomes no what what happened. For a example, a tournament may be set up such that only one individual wins, even if such a winning condition were not explicitly dictated. Such was the third insight.\n\nAs elegant as it was, the dual view of networks of individuals as networks of models was more of a mathematical abstraction than a true description of the physical world, where causality reigned supreme. However, as the numbers of individuals in the networks increased and their interconnections were wound ever more tightly, the better this approximation would be. The more the models could come to life. Such was its final insight.\n\nIn such a world, if it could be achieved, the difference between prediction and action—between prophesy and future—was a meaningless one.\n\n“Why was the Review sent to us?” Williams asked. “And why did we keep it?”\n\n“The author of the Review had a dream of a peaceful world,” Powell said.\n\n“And we, the means to achieve her dream. Because we control the most liquid predictive market in the world, connecting traders and investors across the world who interact daily with each other. The new Fed was born in the flames of the Second World War. The moment Marriner Eccles received the translation of her manuscript in 1941.”\n\n“What is the Fed actually doing?!” Williams stood from his seat.\n“You cannot even imagine,” Powell shook as he placed his eyeglasses on the table. “What it means to control the yield curve.”\nYield curve control? Wasn’t that the newfangled policy that the Bank of Japan had first rolled out. Williams looked at Powell blankly.\n\n“Wait.”\n\n“Yes?” \n“The yield curve does not predict central bank intervention,” Williams muttered to himself. “The change in the yield curve IS central bank intervention.”\nPowell laughed heartily as he saw the flash of realization over Williams’ face. He had been waiting patiently for this moment.\n\n“The yield curve whispers to us from the future,” Powell said. “Because we have set up a massive anticipatory network according to the conditions set forth in the Review. A network that allows is to send messages to our past selves.”\n\nThis was all so ridiculous to Williams, but not much more so than the retconned creation mythology of the Federal Reserve. He had nursed his own private doubts about the dual mandate of late, views which he dared not air in public.\n\n“The Federal Reserve acts as the eyes of the Republic, providing advance warning of threats to our democracy,” Powell said proudly. “Our stewardship of capital markets is of secondary concern.”\n\nWilliams plopped back into his chair, ready to receive his true mission.\n\n“The the treasury market transmission network is still an imperfect one, the financial equivalent of a smoke signals,” Powell explained. “We communicate by inverting the yield curve, and encode information in the timing and the choice of tenors that get inverted. Anything more complicated than that becomes garbled when you try to send messages years back in time.”\n\n“Last December, the three year and five year inverted, followed by the two year and five year a day afterward. According to our protocol, this pattern signals mass unrest within two years, with more information to follow. We proceeded by calibrating our monetary antennae by adjusting the federal feds rate upward until we received a follow-up signal. Which we received just this morning, when the three month and ten year flipped. America is going to be hit with a global pandemic.\n\n“We’ve tried to warn the executive branch about it. However, unlike in the past, the executive branch is not responding as decisively to the intelligence as we had hoped. The situation is bleak. This is the first time we have operated alone. And there’s only so much the eyes of the Republic can do.”\n\n“Does no one else know?” Williams asked.\n\n“The true purpose of the Federal Reserve is only revealed to the President, a few of his or her trusted advisors, and me,” Powell said. “And I’m breaching protocol by telling you.”\n\nPowell rubbed his sleepless eyes. “But I believe that there’s a special destiny that comes with working at the New York Fed.”\n\n“Thanks but,” Williams said. “I’m not sure how I can help.”\n\n“To be frank with you, I’m not exactly sure what to do either. But I’ve always known you to have a good head on your shoulders. We’ll think of something.”\n\n“Okay.” His boss could be overbearing sometimes, Williams thought.\n“And we’re going to have to meet in person more often than our quarterly FOMC committee meetings.”\n\n“Sure,” Williams agreed with a sense of dread. Even with the weight of the country on his shoulders, he did not look forward to long commutes to the capital. “Whatever it takes.”\n\nThe two men stared at each other from across the table for a while, before Williams interrupted. “So now what?”\n\n“It’s only six,” Powell said, glancing at the clock. “Are you free to join me for an early supper? My treat, of course.”\n\n“Let me tell my family then,” Williams said. “And I will get to choose the place this time.”\n\nPowell laughed again as he reached for his messenger bag to go.\n\n“So it’s all a waste of time then?” Williams asked as he rose from the chair, cradling the Review underneath his arm.\n\n“What?”\n\n“All the discussion about the economy and rate hikes and rate cuts? It’s all just a front for fiddling with the dials on a massive time machine.”\n\n“Correct.”\n\n“No wonder it never made any sense.”\n\nWilliams held open the door dutifully for Powell.\n\n“You know…” The chairman hesitated thoughtfully at the exit. “The plunge protection team actually exists.”\n\n“Yea I know, the Working Group on Financial Markets.”\n\n“No, not that one. There’s a group of Fed traders who manipulate spooz around two and three AM in the morning. It’s a short-distance communication system that sends messages months rather than years into the past.”\n\n“Sheesh, what else are you hiding?”\n\nPowell winked. “The Eccles building is very large for a reason.”\n\nFin.\n\n1) consider changing the story to be about a secondary character uncovering a mystery instead of the NY Fed chair?\n2) the part about the complex systems thing is hard to follow\n(Not necessarily good or bad)\n\n3) consider adding B-plot (fed pres has to get flowers for his wife kind of BS, something for him to think about) - humanize and add conflict\n\nEven though she was just a recent intern, he had asked her to go with him to the committee meeting at the capital.\n\nShe had caught him uncharacteristically slacking off yesterday from the corner of her eye, framed in the darkened reflection of her phone. Just quietly standing in the side. Not working. She pretended not to notice. The man rarely took interest in anything other than work and was consumed by the responsibilities and duties of heading the New York office. But Williams could be odd sometimes. Perhaps he was just staring into space.\n\nAnd suddenly, Williams, her stiff boss, asked her out for lunch today. He had done so in his characteristically awkward fashion.\nShe was worried. Not for herself, but for him.\nSomething was not right with her boss.\nAs she pondered his invitation,\nShe wondered if his expression, which she had interpreted as shyness, was instead a look of silent horror.\n\nAs she walked back to her workstation, she tried to piece together the events of the last week.\nWilliams had become absent-minded ever since he returned from his trip to the capital two days ago.\nHe clammed up when she asked him how the committee meeting went.\n\nDrained.\n“How was the powwow with the Powell?” she asked him on Thursday morning. \nHow was the, she ribbed him about it. The kind of humor that made him chortle. But A face of indescribable horror.\n\nAt first it was just creepy\nHe had stood in front of her desk, mouth slightly open as if to ask for a favor. Hesitating for a moment, he brushed off .\nShe watched him for a moment before walking back to her desk.\n\nHe had caught him staring into her cubicle, from . She had pretended not to notice.\nwasn’t sure what to make of it. \nShe popped\n“Yea.” He sat in his chair, slightly rattled.\n\nHe would stopped by her desk, as if to ask for a favor, and t hesitate and then proceed back to his office as if nothing had happened.\nAt first she worried.\nFor his sake.\nHe had grown forgetful. She had , and didn’t like. \nEver since the conclave in the capital.\nE\nHer intuition was more flexible.\nWorking on Wall Street. Working\nWilliams did not understand.\n\nLong ago,  But now he was the regional president of the New York Fed, while she was just another rank-and-file economist in the lower echelons of the Division of Financial Stability.\n\nAs Williams thumbed through the text, interspersed with mathematical notation.\n\nAnd the most curious puzzle of all\n\n\n\n\n\nThe greying chairman pulled out a sheaf of papers and slid them across the table.  Powell’s watchful expression delivered him for a moment back to the ordeals of graduate school, sweating in front of his dissertation committee.\n\nI’m so sorry,\n\ngrasping at straws, I need someone to trust\n\n“Is this about the papers you sent me?”\n\n“Sorry?”\n\n“Never mind,” she stirred her tea.\n\nAlex took off her headphones and rested them on her neck.\n\n“What for?”\n\nas if it were the most normal\n\n“Oh, for real?”\n\n“Do you need something?”\n\n“Nope.” Williams stood meekly in the doorway. “Just passing by.”\n\n“Well, you look like you want to talk.”\n\n“Not really,” Williams said as he walked into the room, carefully stepping past the crates of papers piled high on the office floor.\n\ntook a drawn-out sip from his morning coffee. “Maybe I’ll catch you later.”\n\n“Sure, I’ll be here all day if you need me.”\n\nWilliams, who looked about to turn away, suddenly asked. “What are you up to now, anyway?”\n\nWilliams  When he reached her desk, he leaned over to peer at her monitor, as if to catch a glimpse of her mind at work.\n\n“You look busy,” he said of the teeming mass of open tabs.\n\nHe set the cup on the edge of the table as he adjusted the strap on the laptop bag slung over his shoulder.\n\nAlex said as she playfully shooed her boss—or rather, the boss of her boss—away.\n\n“Aww, back to work then.” Williams slung a laptop bag over his shoulder and marched back towards the entrance, weaving through the crates of papers piled high on the office floor.\n\nWilliams had always been impressed with her intellect and contrarian streak. Despite that, he kept abreast of her work. He was always quick to email her comments on her latest working papers and occasionally dropped by unexpectedly.\n\nShe was just about to return to revising her latest draft when her hand bumped against something, knocking it over. It was Williams’ coffee—he had run off in a hurry and left it behind.\n\n“Shit,” she hissed as she yanked her keyboard away to protect it from the fallout.\n\nBut the paper cup simply rolled off the table onto the carpet. Setting down the keyboard, she bent over to pick it up. As she pried its lid open, she saw that the cup was entirely empty with no trace of ever having contained liquid inside. Instead, there was a wadded-up napkin, which she flattened out on her table to uncover a message scrawled out in smudged ballpoint.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe handwriting was unmistakably his. Long ago. It was back in their Stanford days, when Williams organized the annual scavenger hunt for the economics department, leaving a series of cryptic notes written in code. This time, the note was in plain English, but far more mysterious.\n",

These are the core concepts of Epsilon Theory.\n\n  The concept of Narrative is a thoroughly post-modern idea. What I mean by this is that Narrative is a social construction, a malleable public representation of malleable public statements that lacks any inherent Truth with a capital T. In fact, the public statements that go into the construction of a Narrative are often intentionally untrue.\n\n  …\n\n  No, I want to use a proper conception of Narrative, which has no inherent notion of truthfulness and is simply a public representation of a set of public statements made by influential people about the world, because I think that this can help me predict market behaviors that are not easily predictable by factor-based or econometric analysis. To that end, my goal with Epsilon Theory is to identify Narratives, measure their strength, and assess their likely impact on security prices through an application of game theory and information theory.\n\n  …\n\n  It’s the new Narratives, though, that I am most interested in. How do they emerge? How do they sustain themselves? How do they manifest themselves in predictable patterns of behavior?\n\n\n\n  Alles gesellschaftliche Leben ist wesentlich praktisch. Alle Mysterien, welche die Theorie zum Mystizism[us] veranlassen, finden ihre rationelle Lösung in der menschlichen Praxis und im Begreifen dieser Praxis\n\n\n“”sdfds\n\nassadsd\n\n This is a blog about stories— about old, forgotten stories that emerge in new, unexpected places.\n",
