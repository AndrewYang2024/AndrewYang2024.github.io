        "content": "An alternative account of the events of Friday, March 22, 2019.\n\n Alex was a master of the coffee nap.   Despite her worn-down state, she could gauge the depth of her exhaustion in precise degrees of caffeine. Three to be exact. A triple-shot of espresso would be enough to nudge her awake after ten beautiful minutes of sleep.\n\nHer home office was furnished with a pristine espresso machine, which stood proudly as the bastion of her productivity. Although her skill with the Swiss-made instrument was by no means impressive, the shots she pulled still surpassed what passed for “joe” in her adopted country. Bad coffee was just one of many indignities that America inflicted on her Continentally-raised palate—a disgusting substance whose only redeeming quality was convenience.\n\nBut the espresso machine was out of commission that night, waiting on parts that she had ordered the week before. Instead, she walked over to the refrigerator in the kitchenette and cracked open a bottle of cold brew. It was as if lowering the temperature had induced a phase transition, transmuting what was once non-ingestable into something more tolerable. The cold numbed her tongue to the taste as she forced down the mud-brown liquid. Having flooded her gullet with sufficient stimulus, along with a few tea biscuits, she stumbled onto her bed. The cool spring night was bleeding into dawn, and the birds perched outside of her bedroom window were already calling in the new morning. Without a care for them or for the world, she lay flat on her belly and slept.\n\n Alex dreamt that she was flying under a moonless sky.   Her arms dangled loosely in the shape of a V, passively generating lift. Flying felt much like swimming, she thought, without the exercise. She was searching for her companions, a flock of albatrosses that had merged with her not long ago, but they proved difficult to spot in the rolling fog. The birds had simply melted away into the murkiness of the sea mist.\n\nThough nowhere seen, their wingbeats reverberated through the moist night air, leaving an audible trail to follow. She cocked her head to triangulate the source of the sound, which seemed to arrive uniformly from every direction. It was then that she realized that the sound came directly from above her. It was a balmy night, she observed. Her feathery friends were probably circling overhead, riding the rising thermals over the sea. She kicked her feet out for an extra burst of speed and took off in a corkscrew. Their wingbeats grew louder as she climbed higher. Her hair was whipped wildly around, its strands dancing from her scalp, as she rounded each coil of the spiral.\n\nThe air erupted into a chorus of birdsong when she finally shot out from the sea fog, greeting her late arrival to the party. Inundated by the raucous welcome, Alex fell into a daze—the moonless sky a starry tapestry above her head, the mist a damp carpet below her feet.\n\nYet there was a small detail that bothered Alex and interrupted her suspension within the moment. The albatrosses, their beaks opening and closing in rhythm, warbled in the familiar chirping of tree-bound sparrows rather than the shrieking calls of roving seabirds she expected. As pinpricks of starlight widened into glimmers of sunbeams, she realized that they were not chirping hello, but rather goodbye. Perched on the threshold of wakefulness, she hesitated, wanting just to stay a little longer in the world of her dreams.\n\nIt was then that she stalled.\n\nSuddenly, the wind no longer whipped against her face. Waving wildly, she tried to latch onto the invisible currents that had carried her up, but their slippery strands simply parted at her fingertips. The chirping of the birds grew to a fever pitch as they gawked in horror.\n\nAlex plummeted straight into the depths of the fog, screaming as she contemplated the horror of slamming into the ocean at terminal velocity.\n\nBut the pain never came. There was no splash. Not even a sense of where atmosphere ended and water began. At the end of her descent, she found herself floating atop a shadowy, endless pool of water. Alex scratched her nose and looked around. The fog and the birds were all gone, leaving behind an immaculate sunrise.\n\n“Wo ist alles hin?” she whispered.\n\nThe ocean murmured back in reply.\n\nBrrrrrrrrr\n\nIt was the murmur of eddies toppling over each other across the mirror of water.\n\nBrrrrrrrrr\n\n⊕\n\n The whirring of the printer woke Alex up.   Without reaching for her phone, she reckoned that she had managed to oversleep on a workday. But that was not her immediate concern. Looking over the edge of her pillow, she could read the thin, squinty letters on the printer’s small LED screen, which announced that a fax transmission from an unknown sender was underway. Strange, she thought. She did not remember ever configuring her desktop inkjet to receive faxes. Yet it continued to eject what appeared to be scanned pages from an ancient document into an accumulating heap of paper on the ground.\n\nWhen the LED screen finally blinked off, she stepped into her slippers to gather and collate the mess.\n\nThe document was a typewritten monograph that bore the nondescript title, A Review of Anticipatory Systems, with no author indicated. Alex had seen the term before in graduate school, when she was completing her doctorate at Stanford’s Department of Economics. That was where Williams, her previous upperclassman and current boss, had also went. Anticipatory systems theory was just one of many intellectual rabbit-holes she had indulged in outside of her main academic tack. It brought back memories, both fond and otherwise, to see it again.\n\nWhile thumbing through the sheaf of papers, she saw that pages seventeen and eighteen were missing.\n\nAlex circled the room and then checked underneath the bed. There they were, along with a printed note.\n\n\n  Dear Alexandra,\n\n  Please come to Eccles Conference Room 3C today:\n\n  3:00 PM March 22\n\n  Tell no one else about this.\n\n  —Jay\n\n\nShe wondered if the message was actually intended for her. It could also be an elaborate prank, she reasoned. Her profession attracted the ire of online cranks who wished its practitioners (mostly metaphorical) harm. But if this Jay were actually that Jay, this invitation would be a direct order from her boss’s boss—the chairman himself—that she could not ignore.\n\nIt was almost noon. She checked her notifications. Twenty-seven minutes ago, a colleague had asked her where she was and if she could look over his data analysis after lunch. Biting her lip, she tapped out a terse reply.\n\n\n  I apologize for the short notice. But due to a personal emergency, I will not be in the office today.\n\n  I will still be in contact through email. Feel free to call my cell if you need me urgently.\n\n  Regards,\n\n  Alex\n\n\nShe hit send on the message and shoved the Review into her backpack. If she were to honor this summons, she would have to leave now. It was presumptuous of “Jay” to ask her to simply drop everything and hop on the next train from New York to DC, but she would oblige. What bothered her was not the abruptness of the request. It was the mystery of it, which tortured Alex with her own native sense of curiosity.\n\n Williams glanced downwards at the small table in front of him.  Both his MacBook and a half-eaten Café Acela sandwich competed for his attention. He sighed, shutting the laptop’s lid so he could finish his meager meal in quiet communion with the other solitary Amtrak riders. It was not like he could prepare materials for a surprise meeting he knew nothing about anyway.\n\nAll he had to go on was the anonymous document tucked under his arm. The chairman had referenced it during their conversation earlier.\n\n“Did you read it?” the chairman had asked. “The Review?”\n\n“You mean the one you handed to me on Tuesday? Yea, I did. It’s… strange.”\n\nAlthough some of the mathematical notations were unfamiliar and, in some respects, archaic, every sentence of it was sharply written, even if not immediately comprehensible. Having perused it multiple times, he still could not follow every single one of its threads. Its quizzical nature reminded him of Alex, whose keen wit had mesmerized him since their Stanford days—a secret but purely intellectual crush on his part.\n\n“Good, good.”\n\n“Why do you ask?”\n\n“Come to the usual meeting room as soon as possible and you’ll find out soon enough. I’ll be waiting.”\n\n“Sorry, I’m not in town anymore. I’m back in my regular office now.”\n\n“Oh, my apologies. I thought you were planning to stay for a bit to sort out the rest?”\n\n“I really did want to, but I had to return. Say, could we do a conference call instead?”\n\n“No. I need to speak to you in person. Just you and me.”\n\n“Three then. I can make it to you at three.”\n\n“Okay, I’ll see you then.”\n\n“Anything else?”\n\n“That is all. Goodbye.”\n\nIt was already an inauspicious morning. The ten year had just dipped below the three month tenor, and the chairman’s unexpected phone call lent the yield curve inversion an almost sinister edge. Were the two things somehow connected? He rejected the idea. Curve inversions were something for traders to fret about. Surely there were more important matters to summon him over. Matters that, for some reason, could not be resolved remotely in a conference call.\n\nHe had left DC just two days ago, having suffered through marathon discussions from Tuesday to Wednesday between the chairman, the governors, and the other regional presidents. Together, the committee had arrived at the anti-climactic decision to leave the bedrock benchmark rate untouched, along with a promise to revisit the matter in three months time. His eyelids grew heavy as he reviewed the last decade of monetary decisions in his head. It grew difficult to resist the soft lull of the drifting train.\n\nWilliams woke up just in time to see the train pull into Washington Union station. Dusting off the crumbs on his shirt, he made his way to the portico outside of the entrance of the Main Hall to hail a taxi. Everything was running perfectly on schedule. In no time, he was cruising down the length of Constitution Avenue and riding past the monuments and memorials of the National Mall.\n\n“I’m back,” Williams whispered to himself.\n\nThe taxi dropped him off at the entrance of the Marriner S. Eccles building. Neither quite elegant nor quite ugly, the rectilinear behemoth of Georgia marble cut a striking figure against the clear spring sky. In a city teeming with ornamented symbols of power, it was perhaps only natural that the real thing would be found in an otherwise unadorned structure. To its critics, the Eccles building exuded a neoclassical boredom as unimaginative as the four floors of functionaries who staffed it.\n\nThe chairman was already waiting by the time Williams reached the conference room. The ambience reminded him of a very austere kindergarten, where each committee member customarily sat behind his or her emblazoned nameplate at the yawning oak table. At the center, of course, was Chairman Powell, flanked by Governors Clarida, Quarles, Bowman, and Brainard. Or as they knew each other—Jay, Richard, Randy, Miki, and Lael. Although their names still flashed brightly on the table, the other governors were conspicuously absent—along with all the usual observers and hangers-on inserted in the name of transparency.\n\n“Hello John,” Powell greeted him half-heartedly, turning grim. “Thank you for coming all the way here from New York.”\n\n“No problem at all,” Williams replied as he closed the door behind him, sealing off the room. “Nice to see you again.”\n\nWilliams mustered a smile and took his seat across from the chairman.\n\n“I’m sure you have many questions for me,” Powell began. Even alone, he spoke with the same gravitas he applied to his media appearances—a patient voice honed for the communication of the committee’s esoteric decisions to an implacable outside world.\n\n“Yes,” Williams nodded. “I do.”\n\n“You work with Alexandra Ender, don’t you?”\n\n“Yes. Officially, she’s still an intern, but she’s basically my right-hand woman when it comes to policy. Wicked sharp.” Williams stopped himself before gushing further.\n\n“So you trust her?”\n\n“Absolutely, we’ve known each other for years.”\n\n“That’s good to know. I may need someone like her in the future.”\n\n“I’d hate to have her go,” Williams laughed. “But I’d be happy to leave you her number and email.”\n\n“No need,” Powell brushed him off. “I prefer more discreet means of contact.”\n\nBefore Williams could press further, Powell’s phone buzzed on the table.\n\n“Yes?” Powell answered as he picked it up. “Okay, send her up to me.”\n\n Alex ascended the spiral staircase towards the third floor,  unsure what lay in wait for her at the end. The stairs brought her to a well-lit corridor. Following the signage, she arrived at a pair of broad, paneled doors. She knocked hesitantly.\n\n“Come in.”\n\nAs she nudged the door ajar, she caught Powell’s eyes peering into her own.\n\n“Now that all of us are together,” Powell said approvingly. “We may begin.”\n\n“Alex?”\n\n“Wait, John? You’re here too?” Alex looked at Williams. “What’s this all about?”\n\n“I have just as much of a clue as you do.”\n\n“There, there,” Powell smiled. “Settle down.”\n\nAlex took up a chair beside Williams and plopped her copy of the Review on the table.\n\n“Now if you may,” the greying chairman folded his hands. “I’d like to know what you thought of it.”\n\nAlex swallowed back a lump. “I was in a bit of rush, so I could only give it a cursory read.”\n\n“But when you were reading it for the first time,” Powell’s eyes were twinkling back at her. “Did something feel odd to you?”\n\nAlex cleared her throat. “It felt intentionally… incomplete? I’m also not sure why this was given to me—”\n\n“Aren’t financial systems an example of an anticipatory system?” Powell interrupted.\n\n“Well, yes.” Alex then quoted from the opening paragraph. “An anticipatory system must have three parts: itself, a predictive model of its own future, and a mechanism to act upon itself based on that model. Examples can be found in biology, finance, psychology, and any other field concerning collective behavior.”\n\n“But your intuition is correct. The text does conceal its true intentions,” Powell said. “The document you hold before you is the translation of an original German manuscript that was smuggled across the Atlantic from the Viennese into the hands of the New York Fed. In order to evade Axis censors, it was vital that it appeared as no more than an innocuous mathematical text.”\n\nNot uncommon for genius to be entwined with revolution, Alex thought, and the Review certainly suggested both.\n\nPowell continued, “I’ll briefly review its core points, just to make sure we are all on the same page here.\n\n“Suppose there exists a network of individual anticipatory systems that interact with each other. As with any interconnected network, the behavior of each individual always depends on the behavior of the others. But for anticipatory networks, the observed behavior of the others may matter less than what that behavior ultimately reveals about the internal predictive models of the other participants. To illustrate this point, a poker tournament can be won while keeping one’s hand face down. One only needs to read the faces of other players and infer their knowledge of the game from their reactions.\n\nPlaying the players, Alex thought. It amused her to think of the chairman as a piker.\n\n“Taking this further, an anticipatory network may sometimes be better understood as a network of models rather than as a network of individuals. To continue my analogy, if people are gambling on the outcome of the tournament without seeing either the players’ faces or their hands, they perceive the event not as a game between poker players but between different poker-playing strategies—inferred from each player’s match history—acting through the conduit of human hands.\n\n“From the gamblers’ perspective, the strategies of each player are in every sense as ‘real’ as the players themselves. After all, the models are the ‘thing’ they are betting on and the humans merely vehicles. The perspective of the anticipatory systems analyst is much the same. The internal predictive models are as real as the underlying systems, and a network of individuals can be conceptualized as a network of models. They are duals. Fundamentally equivalent views that can be naturally exchanged for each other.\n\n“But duals are not identical. Although systems must behave in a strictly causal way, with one interaction leading to another, models do not. The framework of causality simply cannot be applied to the ‘meta-behavior’ of models interacting with other models, because these interactions exist outside of time. To the question, ‘when did rock beat scissors,’ one can only answer, ‘whenever the rules of rock, paper, scissors were first conceivable’—now, then, and forever.\n\n“This acausality has other consequences. Even when the myriad interactions between individuals in a crowd can be exhaustively catalogued, it is often impossible to predict their collective behavior once the number of individuals becomes overwhelming. Much like dealing with the sudden spread of an epidemic, it becomes impossible to trace the chains of causality. On the other hand, it is very easy to design games—even games with very rich behavior—that always converge on completely predictable outcomes no matter how many players it has or how clever its players are. An example is the class of games whose rules do not explicitly specify a winner-take-all dynamic, but guarantee a single winner at the end nonetheless.\n\n“You and I know these games very well.” Powell said. “Don’t we?”\n\n“It’s not like you to beat around the bush.” Williams was tapping his foot. “What does this all mean to us? Why was it sent to us?”\n\n“I find that terrible things tend to happen when I speak plainly,” Powell retorted. “But if you can indulge me for a little longer.”\n\nAlex looked anxiously between her two superiors. She had been quietly taking notes on the chairman’s words the whole time.\n\nPowell continued, “I grant that everything I’ve said up to now sounds far removed from everyday life. And it would be, if not for the appendix on approximation theory.\n\n“An anticipatory network as I have described is still only just an approximation of anticipatory networks in the real world. The model-system duality that follows is but a convenient mathematical abstraction. But if certain conditions hold, this approximation becomes quite good and the duality has real implications.\n\n“For example, if we are able to gather enough people, make their thoughts and actions highly dependent on each other, and then train them such that they respond as much to abstractions as they do to realities, then something interesting emerges. When they can no longer distinguish between symbolic manipulations and physical facts, the distinction between causal behavior and acausal meta-behavior is erased.\n\n“In such a situation the difference between prediction and action—between prophesy and future—is a meaningless one.”\n\nAlex’s blood stirred. Everything was coming together now.\n\n“This was the dream of Astrid Ender, who wrote the Review and arranged for its delivery,” Powell explained. “Your great-grandmother, Alex.”\n\n“Wow,” Williams gasped, looking at her with newfound admiration.\n\n“The Enders are a long intellectual lineage dating back to the Austro-Hungarians,” Powell explained. “Before their collapse, they were quite well-known in monetary circles. It was only a matter of time before Astrid’s descendant would make her way back into the trade.”\n\nThe two men’s scrutiny made Alex shift in her seat. Much to her relief, they quickly returned to their original discussion.\n\n“Do you understand now,” Powell asked solemnly. “What it means to control the yield curve?”\n\nWilliams stared blankly at Powell and felt left behind. He could not comprehend how yield curve control, a newfangled policy from the Bank of Japan, fit into the picture.\n\n“What?”\n\n“Don’t you get it, John?” Alex said. “The yield curve does not predict central bank intervention. The change in the yield curve IS central bank intervention.”\n\nPowell laughed heartily as he saw the flash of realization over Williams’s face. He had been waiting patiently for this moment.\n\n“The yield curve whispers to us from the future,” Powell said. “Because my predecessors have created an anticipatory network that satisfies the conditions set forth in the Review. A machine that can pull forward the eternal future into the present.”\n\n“You had me at acausality,” Alex said. “If I understand correctly, the treasury market allows us to send messages to our past selves.”\n\nPowell nodded approvingly. “This is the true history of the modern Fed, born amid the flames of the Second World War. From the moment Marriner Stoddard Eccles received an anonymous manuscript in 1941. This is why we control the most liquid predictive market in the world and train a global network of traders and investors to do our bidding.”\n\nThis was all so ridiculous to Williams, but less so to Alex. She had nursed her own private doubts about the Federal Reserve’s mandate of late, opinions which she dared not air in public. The retconned creation mythology of the Federal Reserve embodied by the dual-but-actually-triple mandate had always struck her as a theologico-monetary Nicene Creed.\n\n“The Federal Reserve acts as the eyes of the Republic to provide advance warning of threats to our democracy,” Powell said proudly. “Our stewardship of capital markets is of only secondary concern.”\n\nOverwhelmed, Williams sank into his chair.\n\n“The treasury market transmission network we have is still an imperfect one. Basically the financial equivalent of smoke signals,” Powell explained. “We communicate by inverting the yield curve and the information is encoded in the timing and magnitude of the inversion. Anything more complicated than that becomes garbled when you try to send messages years back in time.\n\n\n\n“Last December, the yield spread between the three and five year tenors inverted. According to our operating manuals, this signaled that a historical-level event is about to occur at the beginning of 2020, details pending. Following protocol, we honed the resolution of our monetary antennae by gradually hiking the federal funds rate. We had to stop because the pressure on capital markets became overwhelming, but that ultimately didn’t matter. We received the main message shortly thereafter, when the three month and ten year flipped this morning.”\n\n“Is it the Big One?” William whispered.\n\n“Oh, there’ll be a massive deflationary shock alright,” Powell said. “But that’s not our main problem. The shock will be caused by an environmental catastrophe with global consequences. The shape of the yield curve is somewhat ambiguous because we’re not seeing things at full resolution, but it suggests that the source of the event is somewhere in East Asia, perhaps China.”\n\n“Will there be a follow-up message?” Alex asked. “We have at most nine months to prepare and it would help to narrow down the range of possibilities.”\n\n“There won’t be,” Powell responded. “Once we get a shock, we have to shut down transmissions and return to our role as liquidity provider, which only leaves us with enough time to send an advance warning and then the main message.”\n\nAn air of uncertainty settled in the room. Alex asked, “So what does ‘environmental’ cover?”\n\n“It’s a fairly long list. All the way from significant astronomical impact event, tsunami, climate-induced famine,” Powell rattled off a series of scenarios, “…to a global pandemic. I’m no epidemiologist, but I’ve heard from experts that we are overdue for a flu pandemic.”\n\nWilliams and Alex sat quietly, hoping for some shred of good news.\n\n“I’ve tried to warn the executive branch about it but the current occupants are not responding as decisively as I had hoped. Maybe they do not want to sow panic, but I am not sure. This is the first time the Fed has operated alone and there’s only so much that being the eyes of the Republic can do.”\n\n“Does no one else know?” Williams asked.\n\n“Other than me, the true purpose of the Federal Reserve is revealed only to the President, a few of his trusted advisors, my foreign counterparts, and previous Fed chairs,” Powell said. “And just so you know, I’m breaching protocol by talking to you both. I’m doing it because I believe that there’s a special destiny that comes with leading the New York Fed and with the Ender line.”\n\n“Thanks,” Williams said. “But I’m not sure how I can help.”\n\n“Me neither,” Alex added.\n\n“To be frank with you, I’m not exactly sure what we should do either. But John, I’ve always known you to have a good head on your shoulders. And Alex, you showed resolve by responding quickly to my call. I’m sure we can work through this together.”\n\n“Okay,” Williams agreed timidly. Powell could be overbearing at times.\n\n“And we’re going to have to meet in person, the three of us, more often than our quarterly FOMC meetings.”\n\n“Sure.” The weight of the country pressed on Williams’s shoulders, and the burden of long commutes to the capital gave him a sense of dread. “Whatever it takes.”\n\n“So,” Powell asked. “Any questions?”\n\nAlex and Williams shook their heads mutely.\n\n“Oh, it’s getting late now,” Powell said, glancing over his watch. “Would either of you care to join me for an early supper? Some of Draghi’s proteges will be there and it would be good to make introductions. We’ll eventually need to confer with Mario to warn him.”\n\n“I think I’ll pass, I’ve met most of them anyway,” Williams said reluctantly. “Also need some time to process all this.”\n\n“Have a good one, John,” Powell waved.\n\n“Yea, you too,” Williams replied, before slinking out of the conference room.\n\nThe chairman waited until Williams was out of earshot.\n\n“I guess the Ender is staying?”\n\nThe Ender nodded, pondering her newfound importance.\n\nPowell tilted back in his chair and propped his feet on the table. “Between you and me, I was never quite sure John would be up to the task.”\n\n“I know what what you mean,” Alex said, stifling a chuckle. “But I think he’ll be helpful. At least I hope so.”\n\n“Amen,” Powell quipped.\n\n“So it’s all a waste of time then? All that discussion about the economy and quantitative easing and rate hikes and rate cuts. It’s really all just a front for fiddling with the dials on a massive time machine, right?”\n\n“Correct.”\n\n“Hah, no wonder it never made any sense to me. I figured you were all smarter than that.”\n\n“Some of us,” Powell corrected. “Not everyone is in the know like we are.”\n\n“Makes me wonder what else are you hiding.”\n\n“Well, since you are going to have to find out anyway,” Powell hesitated thoughtfully. “There is a Plunge Protection Team.”\n\n“That’s no secret, it’s called the Working Group on Financial Markets, isn’t it?”\n\n“No, not that one. There’s an actual bunch of algos that manipulate equity futures at around two to three in the morning. The price action inside that illiquid window allows us to establish a parallel short-term communication system that sends messages days rather than years into the past without interfering with stocks too much.”\n\n“Didn’t have that on my bingo card.”\n\n“The Eccles building is large for a reason. It houses things that you cannot even imagine,” Powell winked. “And in due time, you will inherit all of its secrets.”\n\nThose secrets were her birthright, Alex thought, handed to her across three generations.\n\nShe smiled. Was it not the highest irony then, that the Federal Reserve was so indebted to—of all people—Austrian economists?\n\nFin.\n\n\n",

        "excerpt": "However, there is something to 2010s progressive activism that can not be translated to the 1960s. And it is by pinning down that missing element of cultural understanding that we can begin to define wokeness, not as some vague cultural tendency, but as a particular thing that emerged at a particular time to address a particular need.\n",
        "content": " I’m not sure if I have ever  encountered an unironic use of woke in the wild. The first time I ever heard the word was on The Daily Show, where the usage of woke was benignly funny in the same way a middle-aged late-night host saying on fleek or some other newfangled lingo was. Nowadays, I only encounter woke in its pejorative sense, as the root of the problems of late modernity, real or perceived.\n\nThis is a pity because woke is a useful word in describing the cultural phenomenon that emerged out of the 2010s in progressive circles, around when the phrase stay woke hopped from African-American Vernacular English into the mainstream by way of Black Twitter, which gave us such gems as on fleek, based, and you finna die. Any progressive or conservative today would agree that the following sentence, whether or not they agree with its message, is obviously woke.\n\n We must center the experiences of black women as we save this country from the forces of white supremacy\n\nThere is something in its jargon, style, and affect that is instantly recognizable.\n\nHowever, the sentiment expressed above would not have been entirely unintelligible in an earlier era. It was no secret that the spotlight of the civil rights movement of the 1960s was dominated by charismatic men. To be a Black woman in the segregationist South was to be doubly condemned, on the basis of race and then of gender. In that light, I can perfectly imagine an old preacher from Atlanta calling on his congregation to remind themselves of the experiences of Black women in the shared struggle against segregation. And it would have been good advice, too! The movement needed the energy of women organizers—many of whom were written out of and belatedly added back into civil rights history—and it hurt the movement to alienate them.\n\nHowever, there is something to 2010s progressive activism that can not be translated to the 1960s. And it is by pinning down that missing element of cultural understanding that we can begin to define wokeness, not as some vague cultural tendency, but as a particular thing that emerged at a particular time to address a particular need.\n\nMorning: Definition\n\nI will try my best here to arrive a neutral definition of wokeness, as something other than a bogeyman to fear or as part of a political program to promote. Because although wokeness is associated with a set of specific political positions, it is not inherent to them.\n\nLet us consider the phrasing of same-sex marriage versus queer rights. The somewhat clinical, even neutral, phrasing of same-sex marriage simply asks that society tweak its existing notion of marriage to consider the alternative where the sex of one partner has been interchanged. On the other hand, the language of queer rights demands that society acknowledge the existence of queer identities up-front. It recognizes that non-heterosexual relationships aren’t merely an extension of a franchise developed by heterosexuals, but something distinct unto themselves.\n\nFrom a branding perspective, calling it same-sex marriage may have been the better pitch when convincing skeptics about legalization. However, the second approach strikes me as a more honest one. The dynamics of queer relationships do generally differ from those of straight relationships. And queer couples do generally view their queerness differently than straight couples think (or not think) about their own straightness. Although I do not think these differences matter from the legal standpoint of granting marriage licenses, I do think they are meaningful to talk about.\n\n ⊕As Steve Valocchi wrote in The Class-Inflected Nature of Gay Identity (1999): The definition of ‘the homosexual’—a unitary label characterized by same-sex object choice—emerged first in middle class urban cultures during the first half of the twentieth century as sexologists and other medical specialists pursued the profession-enhancing project of naming and categorizing. The emerging definition, however, coexisted with a variety of alternative definitions in working class and African-American urban communities as segments of the middle class homosexual community adopted the scientific definition of same-sex object choice. This middle class definition became the definition that was pushed from above as the American psychiatric establishment allied itself to state power in the mobilization for World War II. \n\nFundamentally, saying neither same-sex marriage nor queer rights conveys a different view on equal legal rights, but they do suggest different ways to get there. The former especially appeals to a middle-class sensibility in keeping with the rest of polite society, while the latter is explicitly affirmational. By asserting one’s pride of place, one directly confronts an unjust society and one’s own internalized grief about it simultaneously.\n\nI’m here and I’m queer\n\nProgressivism, speaking broadly, seeks to reduce the imbalances between disadvantaged groups and advantaged ones by securing equal resources and rights for all. Wokeness is the view that this material and legal process is intrinsically tied to securing representation in the cultural realm, even if it means—especially if it means—an uncomfortable confrontation with the majority. There is no option for a marginalized group to just be folded into the majority culture while enjoying equal benefits, because meaningful equality cannot truly happen without full recognition.\n\nHistory is littered with examples of ethnic and religious minorities who, despite coexisting with their neighbors quite well for centuries, were suddenly uprooted by pogroms and expulsions. Blending into the background seems like a pretty good deal until it’s not. As such, it’s not a bad idea to attain some degree of cultural visibility as a form of protection against that. Minority cultures have always tried to curry such cultural favor: assuming high offices in the imperial court of the reigning monarch, writing themselves favorably into popular literature and poetry to drown out their usual depictions as child-snatchers or whatever ghoulish caricature, and so on. Along the way, they also develop pride about their own identity and can participate fully in life without keeping heads down.\n\nWhere wokeness diverges from history is that its form of identity politics isn’t attached to a specific marginalized identity. Its state of flux is reflected in its evolving acronyms, which both refine (POC to BIPOC) and expand (LGBT to LGBTQIA+) categories as they acquire more letters.\n\n\n\nIt is by listing out the numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, … that we arrive at the notion of the set of natural numbers denoted by the symbol of the double-struck capital N, which isn’t a number at all. Similarly, the identity in identity politics has no identity, except as an eternal variable or placeholder for posterity.\n\nThis lack of specificity is perfectly logical if one wishes to avoid accidentally marginalizing any particular identity. In practice, there may be implicit or explicit hierarchies depending on what people are present in a given context and the views they hold, but in theory, the framework of wokeness does not want to commit itself to any set list of sanctioned identities. Instead, it encourages the exploration of new identities among its members as part of liberation from forms of marginalization that they may not even perceive except intense personal interrogation. Under wokeness, diversity is not simply a signal that the progressive project of securing benefits and rights is working, an indicator that the distribution of advantages is probabilistically even. Diversity is an end in itself, part and parcel of liberation.\n\nThis presents a challenge. Organizing a diverse group of people is very hard. Organizing people based on a non-specific idea of identity is astronomically more so. That is, unless you evolve some interchangeable set of practices and language that can be shared even among hyper-specific categories of identity.\n\nWhile we all may not have the same identity, we all at least have one (or more).\n\nHence, there is a strong focus in wokeness about personal experience. By commiserating about how our identities have brought us personal adversity in one way or another and celebrating the moments where we triumphed in affirming those identities, this communal activity provides the vital link that holds the whole enterprise together. By intentionally embracing some degree of fragmentation within—celebrating diversity and difference as an end in itself—the resulting structure is resilient, even antifragile.\n\nTake for example, the straight male. If he chooses to participate, he is now reborn as a cishet, which is both the same thing and yet different. While cishet may be statistically, the majority, it is now just another category under the whole spectrum, just as valid as all the others. He can participate in the same commiseration and celebration with his newfound allies, albeit in a different form. His confrontation with marginalization is at the opposite end, as the one historically imposing marginalization on others. An outside critic might think it a raw deal, assuming a historical debt he does not owe to anyone, but he may feel just fine. He might even feel more in tune with who he is, not just as a random guy who popped into being one day and really likes video games or something but as an individual aware of his own place in the larger sweep of social history. He is, in its own way, welcomed to the ever-expanding club.\n\nBecause personal experience is the connective tissue that holds it all together, there isn’t a boundary between one’s personal and political life. The drama of political struggle plays out in the theater of everyday living, and vice versa. The constant awareness of this added dimension to everyday life becomes a back-and-forth between the general and the particular until you can no longer (want to) distinguish between the two.\n\nThe use of whiteness and anti-blackness refer as much to faceless, structural forms of discrimination as to specific instances of white individuals one encountered recently. In fact, even in the same breath.\n\nThere also isn’t a boundary between one political issue and another. As all politics is about people, and all peoples suffer some form of marginalization, there is a dimension of identity to all the major issues of our time, whether it be racial justice (obviously) or climate change—now as climate justice because it is also about protecting Black and Brown communities impacted by rising sea levels and the like.\n\nTo return to the beginning, wokeness is not a policy platform. It is a paradigm that is layered onto different progressive policies to glue them into one cohesive movement by using a generalized construct of identity and encouraging a constant level of awareness about it.\n\nI would be careful not to conflate the rise of wokeness within a secular trend of rising social progressivism, where people are genuinely becoming more open-minded and less spiteful about differences. A lot of people across the country, on the coasts or in its vast interior, many of whom would not even be remotely considered woke or familiar with the jargon, turned out in the streets for George Floyd. A decade or so ago, they would have been content to privately condemn the offending officer’s conduct in polite company but stayed off the streets altogether.\n\n ⊕The role of fun in politics is often underrated and de-emphasized to preserve the sanctity and seriousness of the venture. But the essence of having a good time every now and then would have been as relevant to a peasant revolt then—imagine an Instagram post captioned “me and the boys torching the debt ledgers”—as it is now.  \n\nBut considering its explosive rise over the last decade, I would say that wokeness is actually pretty successful at mobilizing people, if that is the criterion by which one considers success. All politics is unnatural, which is why, as a general rule, people are reluctant to “get political.” By incorporating a personal dimension, wokeness makes politics highly accessible and even fun.\n\nWokeness is genuinely an innovation to progressive politics. It is no coincidence that I cited examples from queer history when trying to explain the phenomenon. I don’t think it could have emerged except as a response to the rise of the queer and trans rights movements and the need to position them organically within the broader coalition for social justice. Like any novel development, it will draw on elements and jargon from older left-wing political and academic traditions, which leads critics to pin its origins on post-modernism, critical theory, the Frankfurt School, political correctness, Marxism, communism, or what-have-you. However, all these explanations fail to explain why this highly recognizable phenomenon came about so rapidly in the 2010s rather than in the 1960s or any other era of left-wing college activism.\n\nNoon: The Tumblr Hypothesis\n\nEnter the Tumblr hypothesis, presented by Katherine Dee Better known as @default friend on Twitter  which basically pins the origin of wokeness on Tumblr. The chronology checks out, as both emerged around the 2010s. It struck me in its simplicity—I do like me a parisimonious theory—and inspired this whole essay in response, though I have to admit I was initially skeptical and still somewhat am.\n\nBut that insight prompted me to think of an online conversation I had lurked on (out of curiosity) involving a group of anti-police protesters. It was at the height of tensions in the summer of 2020. There were real stakes, given that police were definitely surveilling the chat and arrest was a constant worry in their IRL activities. These guys talked the anarchist talk and walked the anarchist walk. But occasionally, they would start comforting each other, reminding each other to “self-care” amidst the revolution. Now and then, one of the accounts with a furry profile picture would also chime in.\n\nWhile the above image might jar with existing conceptions about what black bloc anarchists are supposed to look like, it is instantly recognizable to anyone who frequented Tumblr in its heyday. It was as if a community, who were first exposed to politics and social life on an online space, simply retained that vibe when trying to build real-life spaces. Given how online every one is nowadays, this is not too much of a stretch.\n\nThere is more to Dee’s Tumblr hypothesis. Tumblr served as a platform to connect activists organically with non-activists. To look at a Tumblr feed was to scroll through activist posts, personal confessions, and fandom. Non-activists may not have posted their own activist messaging, but they almost certainly reblogged it.\n\n\n  Academia doesn’t exactly pull a crowd, but do you know what does? Media properties like One Direction, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Supernatural, Steven Universe, and Harry Potter.\n\n  Tumblr’s interface made it particularly easy to share and remix content—meaning streams between fandoms and niches was a hallmark of the website. In other words, popular media content that was going to go viral anyway regularly had activist messaging appended to it.\n\n   Katherine Dee,  Tumblr U. \n\n\n\nThe graduates of Tumblr brought their particular habits and aesthetics to college campuses, where they picked the bits of academia that suited them, not the other way around. Moreover, the rise of Tumblr fed a burgeoning clickbait industry, propelling it into the mainstream.\n\n\n  You have a dual problem of writers needing content and going to increasingly obscure sources to procure it, and people strip mining their own lives for content in the service of having an audience read their “personal essays.”\n\n  What do either of these have to do with what the identity politics landscape has become? Both Tumblr and digital publications like Vice, Buzzfeed, Jezebel, Bust, and Rookie (to name just a few) had a much wider reach than academic literature, or even activist groups. You were much more likely to encounter a bastardized interpretation of the meaning of “emotional labor” on your Tumblr feed, or a Vice article regurgitating that Tumblr post, than you were in a classroom.\n\n  Once something is trending online, it’s fair game for a struggling publication, particularly if it lends itself to a catchy, clickable title.\n\n  Even early news articles about topics like “privilege,” or even “trigger warnings,” reference their ubiquity in online spaces, as opposed to within academic ones.\n\n  Take this article 2013 article at The Conversation about trigger warnings. Writer Lauren Rosewarne, a lecturer at the University of Melbourne, describes them as “used mostly on-line to head up discussions of topics like sexual violence, depression or self-mutilation.” It was not a term popular in academia, in activism, nor one that originated in a psychiatric setting for sufferers of PTSD.\n\n\nI really like the Tumblr hypothesis because it’s concrete where other hypotheses about the rise of wokeness are vague (overproduction of elites and college credentials might certainly drive more college students to radical ideologies, but why would they embrace wokeness in particular?) or insinuating from academic obscurities few have ever read. It tickles my confirmation bias to believe that college kids are far more likely to internalize dank memes about academic themes, rather than be radicalized by reading impenetrable theory. The hypothesis is also falsifiable, in that I could conceivably trawl through the corpus of all Tumblr posts and metadata and survey all Tumblr users about their platform usage and political engagement over time, to either prove or debunk it.\n\nEven without those research means at my disposal… well, it just makes a lot of sense?\n\nThe proliferation of marginalized identities is formally similar to the proliferation of micro-identities on the internet. Everyone was weirdly obsessive about some particular fandom and you just needed to accept that as a normal thing, because you were probably also part of some micro-community as well. It was a straightforward application of doing unto others as you wished them to do unto you. The internet also encouraged the constant exploration of narrower and narrower subcultures and subgenres in anything imaginable, with an undercurrent of over-enthusiastic tolerance. What appears to other people as a hyper-uncomfortable blurring of boundaries between highly personal affairs and politics is instantly familiar to any young teen who was following anonymous Tumblrinas post about sex on the internet or reading the dime-a-dozen confessions from the personal essay mills. Callout culture and constant self-affirmation makes a lot of sense in decentralized circles—online or activist—because shouting is literally the only remedy you have at your disposal.\n\nAt this point, one might be inclined to infer that wokeness is when a bunch of weirdly online fans ended up adopting politics as their new fandom. But what I am arguing, is something far more specific. A generation of people, of varying participation or even just passive observation of online culture, were first presented with a certain etiquette and experience in a specific online context (that of Tumblr and the clickbait media industry it spawned) and ended up being highly receptive when those elements were presented later in an altered political context. Some of them were ex-Tumblrinas, but I’m sure a lot of them weren’t.\n\nIt doesn’t actually require a lot of people to shift the cultural conversation, and considering how many millenials were on Tumblr (I joined to share my modest art with my more talented friends in high school), it is entirely plausible that a critical mass of receptive Tumblr/Tumblr-adjacent users was achieved to do just that. Once this took hold, it became self-sustaining. There are boomers and zoomers now who have never been on Tumblr, but became woke on TikTok or Facebook or Twitter or whichever platform it is these days.\n\nNight: Conclusion\n\nLike any framework, actually existing wokeness has its blind spots and unresolved questions, many of which are also obvious to its proponents. To name a few:\n\n When personal experience   cannot be rejected and is always valid, how do you deal with dissent?\n\n How does one   deal with corporate or political actors who cynically invoke identity to justify their ends? No one is fooled when the CIA flies the rainbow flag on its social media account. But if you genuinely believe the struggle for material improvement is inseparable from cultural representation, such that neither can be sacrificed for the other, how do you react when a corporation offers genuine improvements in the diversity of its white-collar cadres while continuing to exploit its blue-collar workforce? This is an area where woke pro-capitalist liberals are divided from woke anti-capitalists.\n\n The focus on   the realm of cultural criticism can also divert energy from other more tangible initiatives. Amid the culture wars, embracing identity often means making enemies of potential allies who are economically progressive but dislike the other stuff.\n\n The blurring of   the general and the particular is a poetic conceit I am partial to in literature—I find Ta-Nehisi Coates to be an utterly compelling writer—but one that does not hold up well in daily living.\n\nI generally refuse to dismiss anyone’s trajectory into political participation.  It is hard to summon the activation energy to get involved. Many of us don’t vote or care because we rightfully perceive that the systems that govern us don’t really care about us either. And if we look through the arc of history, political consciousness is a pretty arbitrary process. The leaders of a nascent movement might have just been in the same unit at the military academy or the same reading circle. My own formative political experience began with suggested YouTube videos and finance blogs. But however we get inspired to act, woke or unwoke, we should always look back and see if the framework we inherited can be improved upon.\n\nIf we look at the history of the synthesis of Christian faith and politics, it was pretty sordid and bloody. One recalls Franciscan and Dominican friars whipping up Crusader zeal in Medieval Spain to expel the Jews. Yet, the same formula, linking the notion of salvation and the Passion of the Christ with one’s earthly attempts to do good, is not at all dishonorable and still informs Christian socialists and liberation theologists to this day. And that’s okay.\n\nI consider myself unwoke—even if I do check the boxes on progressive social views—in that I hold to more traditional notions of building solidarity that don’t explicitly center identity. But I would still ask, is it possible to retain the potency of woke identity politics, the union of social progressivism and deep personal experience, while resolving some of its deadlocks?\n\nI do think that wokeness, specifically its formula about identity, is here to stay, especially in activist circles. Given its continued existence, I think it is a losing proposition to stay unduly angry or fearful about it. If I must, I would prefer to be asleep.\n\n Good night.\n\n\n",
