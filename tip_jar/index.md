{% newthought 'And in return, I have some tips for you'%} in case you were curious about the funny looking designs at the upper-left corner. The designs follow a common motif: the lush, calligraphic flourishes of ***theory*** set against the rational, geometric forms of {% newthought  'praxis.' %} with their combination expressed in the ***bra***-***ket*** notation of quantum mechanics. {% marginnote 'mn-id-1'  'a ***bra*** (a linear functional 〈*f*| ) can act on a ***ket*** (a complex vector |*v*〉) in order to produce a  result: 〈*f*|*v*〉 .'   %} Like theory and praxis, the spaces of ***bra***’s and ***ket***’s are dual spaces—both entangled with and separate from each other—not necessarily opposite, but come together in profound ways.


{% marginfigure 'mf-id-1' 'assets/img/000.png' '**Main |**  The duality of two single quotes---left and right--- a rounded ink dot in the vague shape of an epsilon, and a sans-serif shape suggestive of a p for praxis.'  %} 

{% marginfigure 'mf-id-2' 'assets/img/001.png' '**About |** Two question marks, with one slightly discombobulated'  %}
{% marginfigure 'mf-id-3' 'assets/img/002.png' '**Tip Jar |** A sickle with a flourish, driven through with a hammer'  %}
{% marginfigure 'mf-id-4' 'assets/img/003.png' '**Index (or Archive) |** An "r" and a stylized "χ"'  %}
