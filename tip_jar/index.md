{% newthought 'In return, I have some tips for you.'%} If you are curious about the funny looking designs at the upper-left corner, all the designs follow a common motif. The lush, calligraphic flourishes of ***theory*** are set against the rational, geometric forms of {% newthought  'praxis,' %} and their combination is expressed in the ***bra***-***ket*** notation of quantum mechanics. {% marginnote 'mn-id-1'  'A linear functional〈*f*| (***bra***)  acts on a complex vector |*v*〉(***ket***) to create〈*f*|*v*〉(***bra-ket***)'   %} Like theory and praxis, the spaces of ***bra***’s and ***ket***’s are dual spaces—both entangled with and separate from each other—destined to recombine in profound ways.


{% marginfigure 'mf-id-1' 'assets/img/000.png' '**Main |**  The duality of two single quotes---left and right--- a rounded ink dot in the vague shape of an epsilon, and a sans-serif shape suggestive of a p for praxis.'  %}

{% marginfigure 'mf-id-3' 'assets/img/002.png' '**Tip Jar |** A sickle with a flourish, driven through with a hammer'  %}
